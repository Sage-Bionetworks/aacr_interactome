Pembrolizumab is a PD-1 inhibitor that has demonstrated activity in HNSCC with ORR of 14%. Study DV3-MEL-01 (NCT02521870) assesses the safety and preliminary efficacy of SD-101 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC.<br /><b>Methods: </b>In phase 2 expansion cohort for anti-PD-1 treatment na\u00efve HNSCC patients, SD-101 was injected in a single tumor lesion (weekly x 4 doses then every 3 weeks x 7 doses) at 8 mg and pembrolizumab was administered intravenously at 200 mg every 3 weeks. Responses are assessed per investigator using RECIST v1.1/irRECIST.<br /><b>Preliminary Data and Results: </b>16 anti-PD-1 treatment na\u00efve HNSCC patients are enrolled to date: median age 65 y/o, male 94%, ECOG PS1 63%, median prior lines of therapy 1. SD-101 safety profile consists of flu-like symptoms and injection-site reactions. Grade\u22653 treatment-related AEs observed to date included influenza-like symptoms, myalgia, headache, injection site pain and swelling, and fatigue with each of the toxicities occurring in 1 patient (6.7%). No increase in frequency of known pembrolizumab immune-related AEs has been observed to date. ORR in evaluable pts (n=10) was 40% (4 PRs; 1 SD, 5 PDs with 1 still on treatment). The duration of response will be characterized when follow-up data become more mature. <b><br />Conclusions: </b>In anti-PD-1 treatment na\u00efve HNSCC patients,<b> </b>SD-101 in combination with pembrolizumab showed a promising response rate and has been well tolerated. Full accrual of subjects in this cohort is ongoing.","keywords":"Immunotherapy;Innate immunity;Checkpoint;Head and neck cancers","organ":"Head and neck cancers","target":"TLR9","tumor":"headneck","sage":"target-tumor","pharma":"academia","combo":"yes","model":"clinical"}
