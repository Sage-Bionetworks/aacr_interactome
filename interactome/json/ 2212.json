A greater understanding of the molecular characteristics of individual tumors could ultimately lead to improved treatment options, particularly for subsets of breast cancer patients with unmet needs. Using an unbiased genomics approach to identify membrane-localized tumor associated antigens (TAAs), we have identified a novel breast cancer TAA that can potentially be exploited through antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) therapy. Here, we describe the development of a GFRA1-targeted ADC that demonstrates activity in GFRA1-positive cell lines and PDX tumor models. Work in non-Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) rat toxicology models revealed acceptable toxicity profiles and supports further evaluation of GFRA1-PBD in GFRA1-positive tumors.","keywords":"Antibody;Preclinical;Preclinical;Therapeutics","organ":"Breast cancer","target":"GFRA1","tumor":"breast","sage":"target-tumor","pharma":"pharma","combo":"no","model":"preclinical xeno"}
