Phase 1 preliminary safety data for the overall population and efficacy data for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer (PC) are reported as of 29 Oct 2017 data cutoff.<br /><b>Methods:</b> Adult patients with PC, melanoma, NSCLC, or SCCHN were enrolled in the 3+3 dose-escalation phase 1. Prior treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (in unapproved indications) or IDO inhibitors was not allowed. Patients received epacadostat (25, 50, 75, 100, or 300 mg twice daily [BID]) plus durvalumab (3 or 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks [Q2W]). Safety was assessed in patients receiving \u22651 treatment dose. Response was measured in evaluable patients (\u22651 postbaseline scan or discontinued/died before the first scan) per modified RECIST v1.1.<br /><b>Results: </b>Thirty-four patients were enrolled in phase 1. Median age (range) was 68 (46-84) years; most patients were male (62%) and had an ECOG PS of 1 (82%). There was 1 dose-limiting toxicity (grade 3 rash requiring systemic steroids; epacadostat 300 mg BID plus durvalumab 10 mg/kg Q2W) during the 42-day observation period. The most common (\u226510%) treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were fatigue (32%), pruritus (15%), diarrhea, nausea, and rash (12% each). Grade \u22653 TRAEs occurring in >1 patient included fatigue and rash (n=3 [9%] each). Five patients (15%) discontinued because of TRAEs (grade 1 pneumonitis, grade 2 diarrhea, grade 2 subarachnoid hemorrhage, grade 2 peripheral edema, and grade 3 dyspnea). There were no TRAEs leading to death.<br />Fifteen patients with PC were enrolled across multiple dose levels. Median age (range) was 66 (46-72) years, 67% had liver metastases, and 87% had an ECOG PS of 1. Fourteen patients had received \u22651 prior therapy. PD-L1 expression test results were available in 7/15 patients: 2 had detectable (\u22651%) staining of tumor cells; 5 did not. No responses were observed among patients with PC; the disease control rate was 27% (4 SD) per RECIST v1.1 (1 of 4 patients with SD discontinued treatment because of clinical progression). The median duration of disease control was 156 days (95% CI, 91-219).<br />Epacadostat exposure was consistent with previous reports, except in patients with PC where somewhat lower peak exposures (C<sub>max</sub>) were observed.<br /><b>Conclusions: </b>Epacadostat plus durvalumab was generally well tolerated in patients with advanced cancers; the safety profile was consistent with previous reports of durvalumab and epacadostat as monotherapies. In unselected patients with PC, no objective responses were observed; a phase 2 expansion for PC was not conducted. Epacadostat 100 and 300 mg BID are being evaluated in the ongoing phase 2 expansions, including patients with NSCLC, SCCHN, and urothelial carcinoma.","keywords":"Immunotherapy;Pancreatic cancer;Combination therapy;Phase 1","organ":"Not Applicable","target":"IDO1","tumor":"multiple","sage":"target-tumor","pharma":"academia","combo":"yes","model":"clinical"}
