The recruitment of immune suppressive cells of both myeloid and lymphoid origin contributes to tumor growth and metastasis. CCR2 and CCR5 are 2 CKRs that are expressed on myeloid and T-cell infiltrates in the TME. CCR2 mediates the migration of monocyte-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs) from bone marrow to blood and to the TME. CCR5 directs migration of polymorphonuclear MDSCs (PMN-MDSCs) and regulatory T cells to the TME. In addition, CCR5 potentiates PMN-MDSC immune-suppressive function via arginase-1 and promotes polarization of tumor-associated macrophages into an immune-suppressive phenotype. Each receptor has been shown to play an important role in multiple tumor models. CCR2- and CCR5-selective antagonists, in combination with chemotherapy, have shown positive proof of mechanism in patients with pancreatic and colorectal cancers, respectively. Thus, targeting both receptors with a small-molecule dual antagonist represents a potential novel treatment for cancer. Here we evaluate the antitumor activities of BMS-687681, a small-molecule CCR2/5 dual antagonist, as monotherapy and in combination with immune cell checkpoint blockers (ICBs) in mouse tumor models.<br /><b>Methods:</b> Three syngeneic mouse tumor models (MC38, CT26, and 4T1) were used to determine the antitumor activities of BMS-687681 \u00b1 ICBs (anti-PD-1 and/or anti-CTLA-4). BMS-687681 activity was assessed by comparing its effect on tumor growth inhibition (TGI) and on the number of tumor-free (TF) mice to vehicle control following oral dosing alone or in combination with ICBs. Phenotyping of peripheral and tumor-associated immune cell subsets was also conducted to gain mechanistic insight.<br /><b>Results:</b> Modest to significant TGI was observed with BMS-687681 alone. Combination of BMS-687681 with ICBs demonstrated significantly improved antitumor activity relative to either monotherapy, as measured by both TGI and the number of TF mice. TF mice were monitored for > 50 days following the last drug treatment, and the majority of mice showed no tumor recurrences. These mice were then rechallenged with tumor cells, and tumor growth was monitored for > 40 days. Although tumor growth initially increased following rechallenge, these tumors regressed after a week, and mice remained TF thereafter. The mechanistic basis for the antitumor activity of BMS-687681 \u00b1 ICBs will be presented.<br /><b>Conclusions:</b> BMS-687681, a potent, selective, and orally active CCR2/5 dual antagonist, demonstrated improved antitumor activity in combination with ICBs relative to monotherapy treatment. These findings support the potential utility of CCR2/5 dual antagonism in combination with ICBs as a novel immunotherapy for cancer.","keywords":"Chemokine receptor;Immunosuppression;CCR2/5;Tumor-associated myeloid and T cells","organ":"Not Applicable","target":"CCR2/5","tumor":"colorectal_breast","sage":"target-tumor","pharma":"pharma","combo":"yes","model":"preclinical xeno"}
