This way, they activate the innate and the adaptive immune system. Two different families of TLR9 agonists are currently used in preclinical and clinical studies: Covalently-closed dumbbell-shaped DNA molecules with natural phosphodiester backbone which are protected from degradation by their conformation (dSLIM\u00ae) and single-stranded, oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-ODN) commonly stabilized by phosphorothioates (PTO). However, chemical PTO-modifications have resulted in off-target effects and an unfavorable risk-to-benefit ratio in clinical trials. EnanDIM<sup>\u00ae </sup>are a new family of TLR9 agonists. EnanDIM\u00ae molecules consist of linear single-stranded ODN. Protection against exonucleases is achieved through L-deoxyribose nucleotides instead of the naturally occurring D-deoxyribose nucleotides at their 3\u2019-ends. EnanDIM\u00ae lead to pronounced induction of cyto- and chemokines, like IFN-alpha and IP-10, as well as broad activation of immune cells, like monocytes, NK cells and dendritic cells, within PBMC. Therefore, EnanDIM<sup>\u00ae</sup> were evaluated in various syngeneic murine tumor models for their anti-tumor effects.<br />Methods: Mice were subcutaneously inoculated with either CT26 (colon carcinoma), MC38 (colon carcinoma), EMT-6 (breast cancer), B16F10 (melanoma) or A20 (lymphoma) cells for solid tumor growth. EnanDIM<sup>\u00ae</sup> (250 \u00b5g per dose, intratumoral) was used to treat established tumors. In addition, the capability of EnanDIM\u00ae to modulate the tumor micro-environment (TME) was analyzed via immunohistochemistry in a syngeneic tumor model.<br />Results: Mice in all models showed clear reduction in tumor growth (TGI: 53 to 85%) and, therefore, an increased survival (p \u22640.001, logrank). Notably, in the EMT-6 tumor model 8/10 mice showed complete tumor regression after EnanDIM\u00ae injection. Those 8 mice rejected EMT-6 tumor cells in a subsequent re-challenge study, indicating a sustained immune memory against the tumor, which was in contrast to age-matched na\u00efve mice. When analyzing the TME of mice from the CT26 model an increased immune cell infiltration into the tumor by CD3+, especially CD8+ T cells was detected, showing the ability of EnanDIM\u00ae to beneficially modulate the TME.<br />Conclusions: The enantiomeric TLR9 agonists EnanDIM\u00ae show promising anti-tumor effects in a variety of syngeneic murine tumor models and a beneficial modulation of the TME towards an increase of anti-tumor effector cells. These data provide the basis for a further development of EnanDIM\u00ae<sup></sup> in cancer.","keywords":"Immunomodulation;Tumor microenvironment;T cell","organ":"Not Applicable","target":"TLR9","tumor":"colorectal_lymphoma_melanoma_breast","sage":"target-tumor","pharma":"academia","combo":"no","model":"preclinical xeno"}
