ADCs of these DNA alkylating IGNs were found preclinically to demonstrate better tolerability and an improved overall therapeutic index (TI) compared with those of DNA crosslinking IGNs (Miller, <i>et al</i>., AACR 2017 #53). In our ongoing effort to further explore DNA alkylating effector molecules for ADCs, we disclose here a new class of IGNs (termed BIAs) in which one IGN monomer subunit is connected to a bis-aryl moiety with affinity for the DNA binding pocket. Our initial structure activity relationship (SAR) studies around a series of BIAs identified a set of scaffolds that met our requirement for high <i>in vitro</i> potency. These scaffolds were subsequently modified to incorporate functionalities that allow linkage to an antibody using various linker chemistries. These linkable BIAs displayed high <i>in vitro</i> potency across a panel of cell lines, indicating that the incorporation of a linker was not detrimental to their overall potency. Furthermore, we found that the potency of these linkable BIAs could be modulated by careful selection of substituents on the bis-aryl moiety providing enhanced binding affinity with DNA. Upon identification of lead BIA molecules, conjugates with a folate receptor-\u03b1 (FR\u03b1)-binding antibody were prepared. These ADCs displayed potent, antigen-specific <i>in vitro</i> activity across a panel of FR\u03b1-expressing cell lines. <i>In vivo</i>, these ADCs demonstrated potent efficacy in xenograft models at doses well below the maximum tolerated dose. In light of these findings, BIA ADCs represent a promising new class of DNA alkylating effector molecules for use in the development of ADCs.","keywords":"DNA;Drug delivery;Antibody;Cancer","organ":"Not Applicable","target":"FRA","tumor":"NA","sage":"linker","pharma":"pharma","combo":"no","model":"preclinical xeno"}
