DLK-1 is strongly expressed during fetal development, while its expression is highly restricted in adults. Conversely, DLK-1 gets re-expressed in several tumors, such as neuroblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), rhabdomyosarcoma, small cell lung cancer, myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. Interestingly, in HCC DLK-1 has been shown to be a marker of cancer stem cells, a subpopulation of cells responsible for tumor initiation, growth, metastasis, and recurrence. Altogether, DLK-1 represents an attractive target for an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) approach based on its selective expression in a wide range of malignancies and restricted expression in healthy organs, as well as its expression on HCC cancer stem cells. ADCT-701 is an ADC composed of a humanized IgG1 antibody against human DLK-1, site-specifically conjugated using GlycoconnectTM technology to PL1601, which contains a valine-alanine cleavable linker and the PBD dimer cytotoxin SG3199. The purpose of this study was to characterize the in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activity of ADCT-701 in human cancer cell lines and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models and to determine its safety and tolerability in the rat. In vitro, ADCT-701 demonstrated potent cytotoxicity in a panel of human cancer cell lines of different origin and levels of DLK-1, while its potency was strongly reduced in DLK-1-negative cell lines. In vivo, ADCT-701 showed potent anti-tumor activity in the DLK1-expressing neuroblastoma-derived SK-N-FI xenograft in which a single dose of ADCT-701 at 0.5 or 1 mg/kg showed dose-dependent anti-tumor activity compared to the vehicle- and isotype control ADC-treated mice. At 1 mg/kg, ADCT-701 resulted in 1/9 partial responders (PR) and 4/9 complete responder (CR), one of which was tumor-frees survivors (TFS) at the end of the study on day 60. Moreover, ADCT-701 showed dose-dependent anti-tumor activity in a HCC PDX model when tested as a single dose at 0.1, 0.3 or 1 mg/kg. At the highest dose tested, ADCT-701 resulted in 3/8 PR and 2/8 CR, while none of the mice treated with the vehicle or the isotype-control ADC (1 mg/kg, single dose) showed any activity. ADCT-701 was stable, well tolerated and showed a favorable pharmacokinetic profile in the rat with a half-life of 9 days and a maximum tolerated dose of at least 5 mg/kg. In conclusion, ADCT-701 demonstrated potent and specific in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activity in DLK-1-expressing cancer-derived models and it was stable and well tolerated in the rat, warranting further development of this ADC into the clinic.","keywords":"Targeted drug delivery","organ":"Not Applicable","target":"DLK-1","tumor":"neuroblastoma","sage":"target-tumor","pharma":"academia","combo":"no","model":"preclinical xeno"}
