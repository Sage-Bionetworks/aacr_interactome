This discrepancy is often attributed strictly to deconjugation (Kamath, 2014), however recent evidence suggests that the underlying mechanisms may be more complex. This work employs a computational quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) approach that generates a hypotheses to better understand the impact of drug antibody ratio (DAR) and the resulting changes in molecular properties on overall PK and relative payload disposition as observed in preclinical and clinical studies. Our work establishes the benefit of using computational models to design novel ADCs and to optimize the discovery and development of existing ADCs to better enable clinical trial design.<br />References: Kamath, A.
