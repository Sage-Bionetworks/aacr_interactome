Development Center for Biotechnology, New Taipei City, Taiwan","presenter":"Wei-Ting Sun","text":"Globo H antigen is a hexasaccharide originally isolated as a ceramide-linked glycolipid from the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7. Globo H is also highly expressed in many other cancers such as colon cancer, ovarian cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, and prostate cancer. DCBD16001 is an ADC from humanized anti-Globo H antibody DCBPR1101. DCBPR1101 and DCBD16001 both show good binding affinities against Globo H antigen. DCBD16001 also shows high cytotoxicity in Globo H overexpressing cell line MCF-7 and HCC-1428 and shows no cytotoxicity in Globo H negative cell line BT-474. DCBD16001 can internalize to target cell more than 50% within 4.0 hours. In vivo evaluation data indicates that DCBD16001 shows acceptable PK profiles and good efficacy. It shows nearly 80% tumor growth inhibition in HCC-1428 xenograft model. DCBD16001 is a candidate under pre-clinical development and expected to apply IND submission within two years.","keywords":"Cancer;antibody drug conjugation;globo H","organ":"Breast cancer","target":"Globo-H","tumor":"ovary_hcc","sage":"target-tumor","pharma":"academia","combo":"no","model":"preclinical xeno"}
