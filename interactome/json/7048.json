For the antibody-drug conjugate approach, these constructs are composed of a targeting antigen binding domain, which delivers the cytotoxic domain into the cell. The majority of the cytotoxic payloads used in these constructs are categorized as either microtubule inhibitors or DNA-damaging drugs. We have developed a fusion protein, GrB-Fc-IT4 (MRT-101), that contains a humanized scFv binding domain targeting the cell surface receptor Fn14, an antigen highly expressed in a variety of solid tumors, and containing the human serine protease granzyme B (GrB) as the cytotoxic payload. The construct includes the IgG hinge Fc domain linker for efficient dimerization and an overall high molecular weight thereby designed to provide a prolonged serum half-life (~40 h). This unique format mimics human immune effector cell function and induces target cell death through activation of a variety of well described pro-apoptotic cascade signals. Western blot studies on human TNBC cells (MDA-MD-231) have shown that intact MRT101 is translocated into the cytosol in less than 1 h after exposure and is detectable in the cytosol for at least 8 h. The free GrB component is also detected by Western blot 4 h after treatment and persists for up to 8 h. Both of these agents trigger apoptotic cascades through activation of various caspases and induction of mitochondrial damage. Studies demonstrating cytochrome C release and mitochondrial depolarization are ongoing and will be reported. Incubation with the lysosomotropic agent chloroquine did not alter the IC<sub>50</sub> of MRT-101, suggesting that the fusion protein is not appreciably held in the endosomal compartment. <i>In vivo</i> studies have shown that MRT-101 is well tolerated in BALB/c mice after intravenous administration of 5 doses at 20 mg/kg/dose. This dose level showed no evidence of toxicity in any of the major organs such as liver and kidneys. <i>In vivo</i> efficacy studies conducted on NSG-NOD scid mice demonstrated significant tumor growth inhibition of established orthotopic breast tumors (MDA-MB-231), with no tumor growth for up to 30 days after implantation. Treatment of nude mice bearing lung PDX tumors showed a 60% tumor growth inhibition when compared to the vehicle control group. These results, in combination with previous <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies, demonstrate that the completely human MRT-101 construct is a selective, highly potent, non-toxic and effective antigen-driven drug with significant potential for the treatment of Fn-14 positive tumors that acts through a new and unique mechanism of action.
