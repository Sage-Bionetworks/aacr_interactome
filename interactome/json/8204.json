The standard treatment for advanced stages ovarian cancer consists of primary debulking surgery followed by i.v. and i.p. chemotherapy. DM1, or mertansine, is a thiol-containing maytansinoid, that inhibits microtubule assembly and kills various cancer cells at low nM concentration. However, its application in the clinic has been hampered by severe toxic side effects<sup>1</sup>. Its trastuzumab conjugate (T-DM1), which was approved by the FDA in 2013, is a promising therapeutic agent for patients harboring ovarian cancers with high Her-2 expression<sup>2</sup>. However, the general limitation for antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) is low drug content, high clearance by the reticuloendothelial, and high manufacturing cost. To overcome this, we designed and synthesized a novel PEG-based, cholic acid/ DM1 hybrid telodendrimer (PEG<sup>5k</sup>-CA<sub>4</sub>-DM1) comprised of one DM1 molecule and three molecules of maleimide per telodendrimer, which self-assembled into 25nm nanomicelles for targeted therapy against ovarian cancer. To enhance the stability of this nanoparticle, PEG<sup>5k</sup>-Cys<sub>4</sub>-CA<sub>8</sub>, which contain 4 thiol groups per telodendrimer is formulated together with PEG<sup>5k</sup>-CA<sub>4</sub>-DM1 at a ratio of 2:5, to generate thiol/maleimide crosslinked DM1 micellar prodrug (DM1-nano). To further enhance its tumor-targeting ability, the surface of DM1-nano was decorated with LXY30 via a hydrophilic \u201cstealth\u201d linker (EK)<sub>3</sub>, using copper-free \u2018Click\u2019 chemistry. LXY30 is a potent and specific ligand against \u03b1<sub>3</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub> integrin which is overexpressed on the surface of many epithelial cancer cells including a panel of ovarian cancer cell lines (e.g. SKOV-3). Compared with free DM1 and non-targeted DM1-nano, LXY30-EK-DM1-nano not only prevented premature drug release, but also further enhanced tumor targeting ability, drug solubility and <i>in vivo</i> circulation time in blood. When loaded with a fluorescent dye (DiD), LXY30-EK-DM1-nano was found to (i) internalize inside SKOV-3 cells <i>in vitro</i>, (ii) significantly accumulated at the tumor site of SKOV-3 xenograft mice, and (iii) exhibit potent anti-cancer activity <i>in vitro</i> (IC<sub>50</sub>=26nM with SKOV-3 cells) and <i>in vivo</i> (SKOV-3 xenograft model). In addition, LXY30-EK-DM1-nano was found to be significantly more efficacious and less toxic than free DM1 and non-targeted DM1-nano. In conclusion, the LXY30-DM1-nano offers a promising novel nanotherapeutic agent against ovarian cancer.","keywords":"Gynecological cancers: ovarian;DM1;micellar prodrug;drug delivery","organ":"Gynecological cancers: ovarian","target":"HER2","tumor":"ovary","sage":"target-tumor","pharma":"academia","combo":"no","model":"preclinical xeno"}
