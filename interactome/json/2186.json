We have developed a screening assay in which a luciferized tumor cell line expressing a model antigen is co-cultured with a transgenic CD8+ T cell specifically recognizing the model antigen in a H-2<sup>b</sup>-restricted manner. The target tumor cell/T cell assay was screened with a small molecule library to identify compounds that inhibit or enhance T cell-mediated killing of tumor cells in an antigen-dependent manner. The EGFR inhibitor Erlotinib was the top hit that enhanced T cell killing of tumor cells. Subsequent experiments with Erlotinib and additional EGFR inhibitors validated the screen result. EGFR inhibitors increase both basal and IFN-\u03b3-induced antigen processing and presentation of MHC class-I, which enhanced recognition and lysis by CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The tumor cell line was also transduced to constitutively express Cas9, and a pooled CRISPR screen utilizing the same target tumor cell/T cell assay identified sgRNAs targeting EGFR as sensitizing tumor cells to T cell-mediated killing. Combination of PD-1 blockade with EGFR inhibition showed significant synergistic efficacy in the MC38 syngeneic colon cancer model that was superior to PD-1 blockade or EGFR inhibition alone, further validating EGFR inhibitors as immunomodulatory agents that enhance PD-1 checkpoint blockade. This novel target tumor cell/T cell assay can be screened in high-throughput with small molecule libraries and genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 libraries to identify both compounds AND target genes, respectively,<b> </b>that enhance or inhibit T cell recognition and killing of tumor cells.","keywords":"Epidermal growth factor receptor;Antigen presentation;Immunotherapy;CRISPR/Cas9","organ":"Not Applicable","target":"EGFR","tumor":"colorectal","sage":"discovery","pharma":"academia","combo":"yes","model":"preclinical xeno"}
