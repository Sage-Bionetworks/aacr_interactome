ADU-S100, a CDN under clinical evaluation, was administered IT with an optimized dosing regimen to explore the immune requirements for antitumor efficacy in mouse syngeneic tumor models. We show that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are necessary and sufficient for durable antitumor immunity elicited by ADU-S100 and that activation of STING in hematopoietic cells mediates CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell induction. Both type I IFN and TNF\u03b1, which are induced by STING pathway activation, influence the antitumor immune response. The combination of ADU-S100 and anti-PD1 treatment enhances CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-dependent, noninjected tumor control that correlates with an enhanced effector profile of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the tumor. Combination of ADU-S100 with checkpoint inhibition also enhances durable immunity in a poorly immunogenic tumor model. Together, these results elucidate the immune correlates to STING-mediated antitumor efficacy and highlight the potential of combining STING agonists with checkpoint inhibition in the clinic.","keywords":"Checkpoint;Cancer immunotherapy;Innate immunity;Tumor microenvironment","organ":"Not Applicable","target":"STING","tumor":"NA","sage":"target-tumor","pharma":"pharma","combo":"yes","model":"preclinical xeno"}
