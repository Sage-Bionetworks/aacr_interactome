CCR2 and CCR5 are CKRs expressed on both myeloid and T-cell infiltrates in the TME and have been shown to mediate the migration of monocyte/myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and polymorphonuclear MDSCs (PMN-MDSCs), respectively, from bone marrow to the blood and TME. CCR5 can also recruit regulatory T cells to the TME, potentiate PMN-MDSC immunosuppressive function via arginase-1, and polarize tumor-associated macrophages into an immunosuppressive M2 phenotype. Engagement of CCR2 or CCR5 promotes an immunosuppressive environment and prevents antitumor immunity; this has been preclinically validated in multiple tumor types, including pancreatic and colorectal. Preliminary data also support the utility of combination with PD-(L)1 inhibition. Clinically, CCR2- and CCR5-selective antagonists have separately shown proof of mechanism in combination with chemotherapy in pts with pancreatic and colorectal cancers, respectively (1, 2). These encouraging studies support further investigation of CCR2/5 dual antagonism in providing greater benefit to pts than CCR2- or CCR5-selective inhibition when combined with chemotherapy. Here we describe the design of a phase 1b/2, nonrandomized, open-label study of BMS-813160 (small-molecule CCR2/5 dual antagonist) as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy or nivolumab in pts with advanced pancreatic or colorectal cancer (NCT03184870).<br /><b>Methods:</b> Approximately 260 pts aged \u2265 18 years with an ECOG PS of \u2264 1, adequate marrow and organ function, and the ability to undergo pre- and on-treatment biopsies will be enrolled. Exclusion criteria include prior treatment with CCR2 and/or CCR5 inhibitors, requirement for corticosteroids/other immunosuppressive medications, CNS metastases, autoimmune diseases, and symptomatic interstitial lung disease. In part 1, pts will receive BMS-813160 monotherapy safety lead-in for 2 weeks followed by combination with chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil + leucovorin + irinotecan [colorectal cancer] or <i>nab</i>-paclitaxel + gemcitabine [pancreatic cancer]) or nivolumab. In part 2, pts will receive either the same regimens (without a monotherapy lead-in) or BMS-813160 monotherapy. Primary outcomes are safety, tolerability, objective response rate, median duration of response, and progression-free survival rate at 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes are pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of BMS-813160 and immunogenicity of nivolumab.<br /><b>References</b><br />1.
