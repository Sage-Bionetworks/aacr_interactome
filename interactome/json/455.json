Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) signal was known to be an essential EMT promotor. Development of therapeutics for targeting EMT through the TGF-\u03b2 signal may be beneficial for the management of cancer metastasis. Recently, we found that a Traf2- and Nck-interacting kinase (TNIK) inhibitor, named NCB-0846, was capable of attenuating tumor-initiating cells among human colorectal cancer (1, 2). The cross link between EMT and cancer stemness has been revealed in several studies. Therefore we evaluated whether this small-molecule compound could have efficacy to inhibit TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT. NCB-0846 reduced the expression of mesenchymal markers (Vimentin and N-cadherin) and upregulated the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin in A549 and H2228 cells. NCB-0846 suppressed the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad proteins and also inhibited migration, invasion, and metastasis. NCB-0846 inhibited TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT through the down-regulation of TGFBR1 in mRNA levels. MiR-186-5p and miR-320 family were identified as candidate miRNAs that could target TGFBR1 and inhibited TGFBR1 protein expression.NCB-0846 might be a novel therapeutics drugs that targets the invasion and metastasis through inhibiting TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT in lung cancer.<br />1.Masuda M, Sawa M, Yamada T.
