Hence, there is an urgent need to identify novel targets and develop effective drugs to improve pancreatic cancer therapeutic index. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) represent a promising class of drugs for targeted cancer therapy. Here we developed a novel ADC targeting RON receptor tyrosine kinase for potential pancreatic cancer treatment. To this end,<b> </b>we have synthesized a bis-alkylating linker (BL), attached to a lysosomal protease-cleavable dipeptide with payload Monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). The BL-MMAE was then conjugated to Zt/g4 (anti-RON mAb) through cysteine bridging technology to produce Zt/g4-BL-MMAE with a homogeneous conjugation profile and an antibody to drug ratio of 1:4. Zt/g4-BL-MMAE showed significant improvement in drug conjugation homogeneity and serum stability over conventional ADCs prepared through maleimide based linkers. In pancreatic cancer cell lines overexpressing RON, Zt/g4-BL-MMAE specifically targeted RON-expressing tumor cells and was effective in rapid induction of cell surface RON endocytosis. Functional analysis revealed that Zt/g4-BL-MMAE caused cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase, reduction of cell viability and subsequently resulted in massive cell death. The calculated IC50 is in the range of 1 to 2 \u00b5g/ml. We conclude that Zt/g4-BL-MMAE is a novel anti-RON ADC with excellent conjugation profile, serum stability, and selective cytotoxicity for pancreatic cancer cells. This work provides a pharmaceutical opportunity for evaluating potentials of RON-targeted ADCs in pancreatic cancer treatment in the future.<b></b>","keywords":"Antibody;RON;RON;Pancreatic cancer","organ":"Pancreatic cancer","target":"RON","tumor":"pancreas","sage":"target-tumor","pharma":"pharma","combo":"no","model":"preclinical in vitro"}
