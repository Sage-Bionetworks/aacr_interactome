{"ID":"2992","title":"Rational design of small-molecule immune checkpoints' inhibitors","authors":"Khaled Barakat. University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada","presenter":"Khaled Barakat","text":"Blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 pathways recently emerged as a \u2018game changer\u2019 in cancer immunotherapy, leading to the selection of monoclonal-antibodies (MABs) targeting PD-1 as \u2018drug of the year\u2019 for 2013. Although these antibodies restored exhausted T cells\u2019 function to recognize and kill tumor cells, these MABs have numerous disadvantages. These include their very high cost and very severe side effects. Our team has been focused on designing small molecule inhibitors for this pathway. Compared to available MAB therapies, our small molecules may offer a more affordable, more easily administered and better controlled treatment for a variety of cancers. Here, we demonstrate our efforts toward this goal and summarize our data on our promising compounds targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 pathways.","keywords":"Cancer;Immunomodulation;Cancer immunotherapy;Immune response","organ":"Not Applicable","target":"PD1/L1","tumor":"NA","sage":"drug","pharma":"academia","combo":"no","model":"NA"}
