Inst. of Cancer, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical Univ., Chingqing, China","presenter":"Yongsheng Li","text":"The role of receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3), a central factor mediating necroptosis, in tumor immunity is largely unknown. Here we show the significantly decreased RIPK3 in the tumor microenvironment of colorectal cancer (CRC) correlated with the accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Deficiency of RIPK3 boosted the infiltration and immunosuppressive activity of MDSCs in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, the reduction of RIPK3 in MDSCs and colorectal cancer cells elicited NF-\u03baB expression in the nuclei and the transcription of COX-2 which catalyses the synthesis of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). PGE2 exacerbated the immunosuppressive activity of MDSCs, i.e. increased arginase 1 (Arg-1), blunted CD8+ T cell activation and accelerated tumor growth. Moreover, PGE2 inhibited RIPK3 expression while enhanced the expression of NF-\u03baB and COX-2 in MDSCs and CRC cells. Inhibition of COX-2 or PGE2 receptors significantly reversed the immunosuppressive activity of MDSCs and dampened tumorigenesis. The patient databases also delineated the correlation of RIPK3 and COX-2 with CRC survival. Our findings demonstrate a novel signaling circuit by which RIPK3 and PGE2 regulate tumor immunity, and provide potential targets for the immunotherapy of CRC.","keywords":"Gastrointestinal cancers: colorectal;Prostaglandin E2;NF-[kappa]B;Cyclooxygenase","organ":"Gastrointestinal cancers: colorectal","target":"PGE2","tumor":"colorectal","sage":"discovery","pharma":"academia","combo":"no","model":"preclinical xeno"}
