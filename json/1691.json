{"ID":"1691","institution":"Progenra Inc","authors":"Suresh Kumar","text":"Tumor microenvironment (TME) plays critical role in suppressing the immune system\u2019s ability to recognize and destroy cancer cells. Although T cell checkpoint blockers such as anti-PD1 antibodies unleash anti-tumor immune response against a variety of tumors, the complex immunosuppressive tumor milieu necessitates development of additional therapeutic agents to potentiate active drugs and expand the realm of the revolutionary cancer immunotherapy. The presence of highly immunosuppressive Foxp3+ T-regulatory cells (Tregs) in the TME has been correlated with poor prognosis. Thus, depletion of Tregs or impairment of Treg function is considered an attractive therapeutic approach. USP7, a deubiquitylase (DUB) implicated as a critical node in several cancer signaling pathways has emerged as an essential factor in maintaining Treg functions. Treg specific deletion of USP7 impairs Treg function leading to lethal autoimmunity. Using the UbiPro<sup>TM</sup> discovery platform, Progenra has identified selective covalent USP7 inhibitors that were subjected to lead optimization and preclinical evaluation. Potent and selective candidate USP7 inhibitors have been shown to impair Treg functions <i>ex vivo</i> and <i>in vivo</i> as well as exhibit powerful anti-tumor activity against syngeneic lung tumor models in immunocompetent mice. Most importantly, Progenra\u2019s USP7 inhibitors enhances the efficacy of anti-PD1 antibody and cancer vaccines. Along with the already established direct anti-tumor activities of USP7 inhibitors, these studies provide a strong rationale for combining USP7 inhibitors to suppress Treg functions and improve the efficacy of currently approved cancer immunotherapy agents.","keywords":"Cancer immunotherapy;Tumor microenvironment;Tumor microenvironment;Tumor immunity","organ":"Lung cancer: non-small cell","topic":"Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy","target":"USP7","tumor":"Lung","combo":"SMI_checkpoint","sage":"immunosuppressive","pharma":"pharma"}
