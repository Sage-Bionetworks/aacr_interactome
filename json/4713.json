{"ID":"4713","institution":"UT MD Anderson Cancer Center","authors":"Seung-Oe Lim","text":"Chronic inflammation in cancer is often associated with disease aggressiveness. Pro-inflammatory cytokines produced in the tumor microenvironment lead to eradication of antitumor immunity and enhanced tumor cell survival. In the current study, we identified TNF\u03b1 as a major factor triggering cancer cell immunosuppression against T cell surveillance via stabilization of programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). We demonstrated that COP9 signalosome 5 (CSN5), induced by NF-\u03baB p65, is required for TNF\u03b1-mediated PD-L1 stabilization in cancer cells. CSN5 inhibits the ubiquitination and degradation of PD-L1. The role of CSN5 in modulating PD-L1 stabilization prompted us to use CSN5 inhibitor, curcumin, to show that it could destabilize PD-L1. Curcumin reduced CSN5 activity to attenuate TNF\u03b1-mediated PD-L1 stabilization and enhanced anti-tumor immunity. Preclinical data demonstrated inhibition of CSN5 sensitized cancer cells to anti-CTLA4 therapy, suggesting CSN5 inhibitor may be a useful adjuvant to enhance immune-based therapies.","keywords":"Immunotherapy;Inflammation;Inflammation;CSN5","organ":"Breast cancer","topic":"Immunomodulatory agents and interventions","target":"CSN5","tumor":"NA","combo":"SMI_checkpoint","sage":"cancer_cell","pharma":"academia"}
