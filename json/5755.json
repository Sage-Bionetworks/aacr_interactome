An immunohistochemical screen for cancer-specific candidates identified a panel of anti-B7-H3 (CD276) mAbs with highly differential tumor-versus-normal tissue binding. B7-H3 expression was observed in tumor epithelium as well as tumor-associated vasculature and stroma. Consistent with our findings, B7-H3 has been reported to be overexpressed in a growing number of solid cancers, including breast, lung, pancreatic, prostate, kidney, and colon cancer, as well as melanoma and glioblastoma. Furthermore, overexpression of B7-H3 has been correlated with disease severity and poor outcome in a number of these cancer types. A humanized version of an anti-B7-H3 mAb engineered with an enhanced Fc domain (enoblituzumab or MGA271) and a humanized Dual-Affinity Re-Targeting (DART\u00ae) protein that recognizes both B7-H3 and CD3 and redirects T cells to kill B7-H3-expressing cells (MGD009) are being investigated in Phase 1 clinical studies. In this nonclinical study, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of anti-B7-H3 antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) toward B7-H3-expressing solid cancers.<br />Methods: A panel of anti-B7-H3 mAbs was screened for internalization and a subset of mAbs that were efficiently internalized by tumor cells was identified. These mAbs were converted to ADCs via chemical conjugation; in vitro and in vivo activity studies were then conducted with a range of tumor cell lines representing human cancer types that overexpress B7-H3.<br />Results: The anti-B7-H3 ADCs exhibited specific, dose-dependent cytotoxicity toward B7-H3-positive tumor cell lines in vitro, including breast, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancer lines, with IC50 values generally in the sub-nM range. Cytotoxicity was not observed with cell lines lacking B7-H3 expression. The anti-B7-H3 ADCs exhibited potent antitumor activity in vivo, resulting in tumor stasis and tumor regression in mice bearing B7-H3-positive human breast, lung, and ovarian tumor xenografts.<br />Conclusion: Anti-B7-H3 ADCs exhibited dose-dependent cytotoxicity in vitro and potent antitumor activity in vivo toward a range of B7-H3-expressing tumor cell lines representing cancer types that overexpress B7-H3. Our findings demonstrate that ADCs targeting B7-H3 may serve as potential therapeutics for B7-H3-expressing solid cancers.","keywords":"Antibody engineering;Immunotherapy;Immunotherapy;Microtubule-interfering agents","category":"EXPERIMENTAL AND MOLECULAR THERAPEUTICS","sage":"ADC","moa":"NA"}
