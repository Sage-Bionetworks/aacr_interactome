IDO-1 expression is upregulated in many cancers and described to be a resistance mechanism to immune checkpoint therapies. IDO-1 is induced in response to inflammatory stimuli such as IFN-\u03b3 and promotes immune tolerance through the catabolism of tryptophan and accumulation of tryptophan catabolites including kynurenine. IDO-1 activity leads to effector T-cell anergy and enhanced Treg function through upregulation of FoxP3. As such, IDO1 is a nexus for the induction of key immunosuppressive mechanisms and represents an important immunotherapeutic target in oncology. We have identified and characterized a new IDO-1 inhibitor. PF-06840003 is a highly selective orally bioavailable IDO-1 inhibitor. PF-06840003 reversed IDO-1-induced T-cell anergy in vitro. In vivo, PF-06840003 reduced intratumoral kynurenine levels in mice by >80% and inhibited tumor growth in multiple preclinical syngeneic models in mice, in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors. PF-0684003 has favorable predicted human pharmacokinetic properties, including a predicted t1/2 of 16-19 hours. These studies highlight the strong potential of PF-06840003 as a clinical candidate in Immuno-Oncology.","keywords":"Cancer immunotherapy;Checkpoint;Checkpoint;T lymphocytes","category":"IMMUNOLOGY","sage":"small combo CPI","moa":"immune"}
