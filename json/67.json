{"ID":"67","institution":"Sutro Biopharma","authors":"Arturo Molina","text":"CD74 is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein involved in the formation and transport of MHC class II protein. CD74 is highly expressed in many B-cell malignancies with limited expression in normal tissues (Stein R. et al., CCR 2007). STRO-001 is a novel CD74-targeting ADC containing an anti-CD74 aglycosylated human IgG1 antibody (SP7219) conjugated to a non-cleavable dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO)-maytansinoid linker-warhead. SP7219 was discovered from a Fab ribosome display library based on Sutro\u2019s Xpress CF<sup>TM </sup>technology. Highly efficient site-specific conjugation enabled by our cell-free antibody production and click chemistry results in a well-defined homogeneous ADC drug product with a drug-antibody ratio (DAR) of 2. Conjugation sites were selected based on highest stability both in vitro and in vivo, thereby limiting loss of drug moiety from STRO-001 in circulation. Due to its limited cell permeability, the major catabolite released by STRO-001 has 1000X lower cell killing activity on CD74 positive and negative cells compared to the reference cytotoxic maytansine. <i>In vitro</i> cytotoxicity assays show potent activity of STRO-001 in a diverse panel of B-cell tumor lines including 4 multiple myeloma (MM), 9 germinal center B-cell (GCB) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 3 activated B-cell (ABC) DLBCL, and 3 mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cell lines with IC<sub>50</sub> ranging from 0.17-20 nM. CD74 cell surface expression is required for STRO-001 cytotoxic activity but expression level, as measured by antibody-binding capacity, does not correlate with <i>in vitro</i> potency (R<sup>2</sup>=0.4640). STRO-001 inhibits the formation of visceral tumors (p<0.004) and prevents growth of CD138+ plasma cells in bone marrow (BM) after 4 weekly doses of 3 mg/kg in the ARP-1 disseminated MM xenograft model. STRO-001 dosed at 3 mg/kg weekly x 3 also eradicates malignant BM plasma cells (p<0.0001) and prolongs survival in the MM.1S disseminated model (100% animals alive at >90 days). STRO-001 exhibits dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition in SU-DHL-6 xenografts starting at 2.5 mg/kg weekly x 3 doses. The combination of bendamustine/rituximab (BR) + STRO-001 further improves tumor suppression in SU-DHL-6 xenografts compared to vehicle (p = 0.002) or BR alone (p = 0.02). Preliminary studies with a MCL xenograft model, Jeko-1, demonstrate potent anti-tumor activity compared to vehicle (p<0.0001) starting at a single STRO-001 dose of 3 mg/kg, with ongoing tumor stasis up to 21 days after treatment. STRO-001 reduces normal B-cells in cynomologous monkeys, providing pharmacodynamic evidence of B-cell targeting. Based on these encouraging observations, STRO-001 is advancing to IND-enabling studies for the treatment of CD74-expressing B-cell malignancies.","keywords":"Multiple myeloma;Antibody Drug Conjugate;Antibody Drug Conjugate;CD74","organ":"Lymphoma: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma","topic":"Antibody technologies","target":"CD74","tumor":"Hemato","combo":"ADC","sage":"target-tumor","pharma":"pharma"}
