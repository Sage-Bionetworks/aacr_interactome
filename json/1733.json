IGN-<b>P1</b> was conjugated via a protease-cleavable peptidic L-alanine-L-alanine linker to a folate receptor \u03b1 (FR\u03b1)-binding antibody, and an EGFR-binding antibody. The resulting ADCs demonstrated high <i>in vitro</i> potency (IC<sub>50</sub> ~4-100 pM) and specificity towards several cancer cell lines. <i>In vivo</i>, anti-FR\u03b1-IGN-<b>P1 </b>induced complete regressions in NCI-H2110 non-small cell lung cancer xenografts following a single dose of 3 \u00b5g/kg (linked payload dose, equivalent to 0.18 mg/kg Ab dose).<br />Here we describe the structure-activity relationship of a number of peptide-linked IGN ADCs, leading to the selection of Ab-IGN-<b>P1 </b>for further advancement. The cytotoxic activities of these peptide-IGN conjugates were evaluated <i>in vitro</i> in cancer cell lines with both high and low target antigen expression. We also assessed bystander activity and identified <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> catabolites. We found that the stereochemistry of the peptide linker was crucial for bystander activity and <i>in vivo</i> efficacy. The IGN-<b>P1</b> ADC exhibited strong bystander activity, which we believe is dictating the strong antitumor activity <i>in vivo.</i> Treatment of low to moderate antigen-expressing models with Ab-IGN-<b>P1</b> further resulted in tumor regressions at doses as low as 3-10 \u00b5g/kg linked payload.<br />These data underscore the potential therapeutic benefit of highly active and specific IGN-<b>P1</b> conjugates, even for the challenging subset of patients with solid tumors where the target antigen is expressed at lower levels.","keywords":"Antibody;DNA;DNA;NA","category":"EXPERIMENTAL AND MOLECULAR THERAPEUTICS","sage":"ADC","moa":"NA"}
