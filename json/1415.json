However, stromal components in the tumor microenvironment may also play a role in ADC penetration, distribution, and processing. Here, we study the potential roles of Fc-Fc\u03b3R interaction between tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and ADCs in the antitumor activity observed in xenograft models.<br />In the CD30+ L428 Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) model, the anti-CD30 ADC (cAC10-vcMMAE) and a non-binding control ADC (h00-vcMMAE) showed similar antitumor activity over a two-week period post treatment initiation. The antitumor activity was correlated with payload release, as h00-vcMMAE produced intratumoral MMAE concentration comparable to cAC10-vcMMAE in this time frame. Histopathology analysis of L-428 xenografts revealed high abundance of TAMs, leading to the hypothesis that TAMs can internalize and process ADCs for payload release. Using immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry, we confirmed that h00-vcMMAE bound to macrophage cell lines and TAMs. We further examined the presence of TAMs in additional xenograft models and correlated that to the antitumor activity of non-binding h00-vcMMAE. High levels of TAMs were observed in the KM-H2 HL and BR620 breast cancer models that were sensitive to h00-vcMMAE. In contrast, xenograft models with much fewer TAMs (DOHH2, SU-DHL8, and Karpas-299) did not respond to h00-vcMMAE treatment. Interestingly, h00-vcMMAF, releasing a membrane non-permeable payload, had no activity on the L-428 tumor model. These data suggest TAM-processed drug can mediate bystander tumor killing when the released payload is membrane permeable.<br />To evaluate whether Fc-Fc\u03b3R interaction plays a role in the ADC uptake by TAMs, we mutated the Fc region of h00-vcMMAE to decrease Fc\u03b3R binding affinity (E233P:L234V:L235, G1V1). h00G1V1-vcMMAE lost its cytotoxicity activity in Fc\u03b3R+ THP-1 monocytes. Furthermore, h00G1V1-vcMMAE could no longer mediate tumor regression or growth delay in three xenograft models that are sensitive to h00-vcMMAE treatment. These results suggest ADC-Fc\u03b3R interaction is required for ADC processing by TAMs in these xenografts.<br />These results suggest that TAMs can contribute to ADC processing through Fc\u03b3R interaction in preclinical tumor models. Moreover, TAM-processed membrane permeable payload can mediate bystander tumor cell killing and contribute to ADC activity. Although this phenomenon may be an additional mechanism of ADCs <i>in vivo</i>, whether TAMs play a role in patients\u2019 response to ADCs requires further correlated studies in clinical trials.","keywords":"Tumor microenvironment;Macrophages;Macrophages;NA","category":"EXPERIMENTAL AND MOLECULAR THERAPEUTICS","sage":"ADC","moa":"NA"}
