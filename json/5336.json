{"ID":"5336","institution":"Progenra Inc","authors":"Feng Wang","text":"The ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7) has emerged as an attractive therapeutic target owing to its critical roles in several cancer signaling pathways as well as its essential role in maintaining Foxp3+ T-regulatory cell (Treg) functions. Pharmacological inhibition of USP7 using Progenra\u2019s small molecule inhibitors resulted in direct anti-tumor activity as well as the unleashing of anti-tumor immunity by suppressing Treg functions. However, the precise mechanism of action these compounds was not well characterized. Using a combination of NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and single amino acid substitution approaches, we have now demonstrated that our USP7 inhibitors specifically target the catalytic cleft of USP7 and covalently modify its active site cysteine (Cys223). Pharmacokinetic studies revealed sustained irreversible USP7 inhibition after short term inhibitor treatment as well as subsequent changes in the level and ubiquitylation of various pharmacodynamic markers, including the Treg lineage specific transcription factor Foxp3. Detailed knowledge of the mechanism of USP7 inhibition has allowed us to incorporate rational design strategies into the lead optimization to obtain improved<br />molecules that will serve as the basis of a new class of anti-cancer immunotherapy agents.","keywords":"Ubiquitination;Cancer;Cancer;Immunomodulation","organ":"Not Applicable","topic":"MUbiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins","target":"USP7","tumor":"NA","combo":"SMI","sage":"immunosuppressive","pharma":"pharma"}
