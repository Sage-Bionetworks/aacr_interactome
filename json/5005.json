{"ID":"5005","institution":"Washington University in St Louis","authors":"Barbara Muz","text":"<b> </b><u>INTRODUCTION</u>: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy localized in the bone marrow. Selectins and CXCR4 play a pivotal role in homing, adhesion, and proliferation of MM. Herein, we tested the role of E-selectin in the pathophysiology of MM by using a specific E-selectin antagonist (GMI-1271) and a dual E-selectin/CXCR4 antagonist (GMI-1359) on the proliferation and cell trafficking of MM <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>.<br /><u>PROCEDURES</u>: Endothelial cells (HUVECs), stromal cells (HS5), MM patient-derived stromal cells (MSP1), and MM cell lines (MM1s, H929, U266 and RPMI8226) were tested for expression of E-selectin, CLA (E-selectin ligand) and CXCR4 by flow cytometry. The effect of GMI-1271 and GMI-1359 was studied on MM cell adhesion to stroma; chemotaxis to stromal media or SDF1; and MM cell survival by MTT assay, where MM cells were treated with lenalidomide or carfilzomib; in the presence, or absence of GMI-1271 or -1359. In a xenograft mouse model, the sensitivity of MM was tested in mice treated with vehicle, lenalidomide, GMI-1271, or a combination of GMI-1271 and lenalidomide (n=10 mice/group); and tumor growth was monitored weekly using bioluminescence imaging.<br /><u>SUMMARY</u>: Expression of E-selectin was high in HUVECs, MSP1 and HS5; CLA was high only in RPMI8226; and CXCR4 was high in all MM cells. MM1s cell adhesion to stroma was decreased by GMI-1271 and even more profoundly decreased by GMI-1359 in a dose-dependent manner. Chemotaxis of MM1s cells towards conditioned media or SDF1 was modestly affected by GMI-1271, but greatly reduced by GMI-1359. MM cell proliferation was significantly inhibited by GMI-1359, only when MM cells were co-cultured with stroma, but not alone. Stroma-induced drug resistance of MM cells to carfilzomib and lenalidomide was reduced in the presence of the GMI compounds, while the effect of GMI-1359 was stronger than GMI-1271. <i>In</i><i> vivo</i>, GMI-1271 and lenalidomide as single agents delayed tumor growth compared to vehicle by 40% and 35%, respectively; however, a combination treatment delayed tumor growth more profoundly than vehicle by 64% (<i>p</i>=0.04).<br /><u>CONCLUSIONS</u>: GMI-1271 and GMI-1359 disrupt the interaction between MM cells and bone marrow microenvironment as determined by reduction of adhesion, chemotaxis and microenvironment-induced drug resistance<i> </i><i>in vitro</i>. However, the dual inhibition of E-selectin and CXCR4 produced more profound effects compared to E-selectin alone. Moreover, GMI-1271 sensitized MM cells to lenalidomide by alleviating chemoresistance and delayed tumor growth <i>in vivo</i>.","keywords":"Multiple myeloma;Tumor microenvironment;Tumor microenvironment;Resistance","organ":"Plasma cell neoplasms (incl. multiple myeloma)","topic":"Tumor/stromal interactions","target":"CXCR4","tumor":"Myeloma","combo":"SMI_other","sage":"immunosuppressive","pharma":"academia"}
