To engineer the optimal diabody TPT format, several constructs were generated to assess the best diabody-deBouganin orientation. All constructs were expressed as a soluble protein in <i>E. coli</i> supernatant and compared with respect to expression level, stability and potency. The optimal configuration consisted of deBouganin genetically linked to the N-terminus of the V<sub>H</sub>-V<sub>L</sub> diabody via a furin protease-sensitive linker and was termed VB7-756. VB7-756 potency was analyzed against a panel of breast cancer cell lines with disparate levels of Her-2 expression and compared to that of Trastuzumab chemically linked to either DM1 (T-DM1) or MMAE (T-MMAE). Overall, VB7-756 was more potent than T-DM1 and T-MMAE with high Her-2 expressing tumor cell lines. In contrast to T-DM1, VB7-756 potency was unaffected by the Her2-Her3 dimerization mediated by heregulin. As opposed to T-DM1 and T-MMAE, which showed only minimal cytoxicity, VB7-756 was highly potent <i>in vitro</i> against tumor cells with cancer stem cell properties. To further differentiate the RIP mechanism of action of deBouganin from tubulin inhibitor reagents, tumor cells that escaped T-DM1 and T-MMAE treatment were incubated in the presence of VB7-756. Results revealed that, VB7-756 was cytotoxic against cancer cells surviving T-DM1 or T-MMAE treatment suggesting that deBouganin can overcome mechanisms of resistance developed by small molecule agents. Moreover, VB7-756 was also cytotoxic against tumor initiating cancer cells evading T-DM1 or T-MMAE toxicity by preventing tumorosphere formation. Overall these results demonstrate that deBouganin\u2019s distinct MOA could overcome mechanisms of resistance affecting the efficacy of small molecule drugs.","keywords":"Antibody engineering;Immunotoxin;Immunotoxin;HER-2","category":"EXPERIMENTAL AND MOLECULAR THERAPEUTICS","sage":"ADC","moa":"NA"}
