{"ID":"685","institution":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia","authors":"Kristopher Bosse","text":"<b>Background:</b> GD2-directed immunotherapeutic strategies have improved outcomes in neuroblastoma; however, the majority of patients treated suffer relapse and GD2 expression on pain fibers causes dose-limiting toxicities.<br /><b>Methods: </b>To identify alternative cell surface immunotherapeutic targets, we compared high-risk neuroblastoma (n=126 tumors) and normal tissue RNA sequencing data (GTEx; n=7859 samples from 31 normal tissues) and prioritized genes by differential and absolute expression and cell surface prediction. Genes were further surveyed for somatic copy number gain and correlative expression with <i>MYCN</i> amplification. Differential protein expression and localization were confirmed in neuroblastoma primary tumors (n=98), patient-derived xenografts (n=32; PDXs), cell lines (n=23), and normal pediatric tissues (n=36). Cell lines were subjected to candidate gene gain and loss of function studies (n=11). Additional pediatric tumor RNA sequencing data was surveyed followed by confirmatory immunohistochemistry (IHC). Finally, candidate specific antibodies were isolated from a human Fab phage library and utilized for antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) engineering followed by cytotoxicity studies.<br /><b>Results:</b> We identified 33 differentially expressed cell surface molecules from which we prioritized glypican-2 (<i>GPC2</i>)<i> </i>for validation given <i>GPC2</i>\u2019s robust differential expression (log-fold change tumor vs. normal tissue = 1.71-9.22; <i>p</i>=1.99 x 10<sup>-9</sup>-1.88 x10<sup>-300</sup>), high-level absolute RNA expression (median FPKM=60), and frequent DNA copy number gain associated with higher <i>GPC2</i> expression (35%, n=182 tumors; <i>p</i><0.005). <i>GPC2</i> expression was also higher in <i>MYCN</i> amplified neuroblastomas (<i>p</i><0.05), MYCN binds the <i>GPC2</i> promoter shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing and reporter assays, and MYCN depletion resulted in decreased GPC2 expression. Immunoblot, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and IHC analysis of primary tumors, PDXs, and cell lines confirmed dense cell surface GPC2 expression. Medulloblastomas (n=62) were also found to have high GPC2<i> </i>expression that positively correlated with <i>MYC</i>, <i>MYCN</i>, and <i>GPC2 </i>loci gain (<i>p</i><0.0001). Pediatric normal tissues had very restricted cell surface GPC2 expression, with only low levels found in the esophagus and skin. GPC2 depletion in neuroblastoma cell lines resulted in apoptosis and growth inhibition and GPC2 forced over-expression increased neuroblastoma cell proliferation (<i>p</i><0.001 for all assays). Finally, a human GPC2 antibody, D3-GPC2-Fab, was developed and shown to bind GPC2 with high affinity and specificity. D3-GPC2-IgG1 induced internalization of GPC2 and was conjugated to pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimers to form an ADC which induced potent and specific cytotoxicity to GPC2 expressing neuroblastoma cells (IC50 = 1.7-11 pM).<br /><b>Conclusions: </b>GPC2 is an oncogene and immunotherapeutic target in neuroblastoma and potentially other cancers.","keywords":"Neuroblastoma;Glypican-2;Glypican-2;N-myc","organ":"Pediatric cancers","topic":"Immunotherapeutic approaches to childhood cancer","target":"GPC2","tumor":"Neuroblastoma","combo":"ADC","sage":"target-tumor","pharma":"academia"}
