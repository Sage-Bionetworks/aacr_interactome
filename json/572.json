{"ID":"572","institution":"Dana-Farber Cancer Inst.","authors":"David Reardon","text":"<b>Purpose</b>: To determine if epacadostat, an oral indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) inhibitor has therapeutic benefit against GBM when administered as single agent and with PD-1 blocking antibody. <b>Methods</b>: An initial survival experiment was performed to assess efficacy and was followed by an identical repeat experiment for validation. 1X10<sup>5</sup> luciferized GL261 cells, a murine GBM tumor line derived from intracerebral methylcholanthrene implantation, were stereotactically implanted intracranially in albino syngeneic C57BL/6 mice. Mice with increasing bioluminescence on days 3 and 6 were randomized (n=8/group) to receive treatment beginning on day 6: anti-PD-1 (332.8H3, mouse IgG1; 500 \u03bcg intraperitoneal (IP) on day 6, 250 \u03bcg q 3 days X 7); epacadostat (Incyte Corporation, orally dosed at 300 mg/kg/day for 5 days on/2days off for 3 weeks); anti-PD-1 + epacadostat; and control therapy (isotype IgG antibody IP and 0.5% methocel in water). Tumor response assessments were performed by quantifying bioluminescence and survival. A re-challenge experiment was performed in long-term survivors to assess for tumor immune responses capable of preventing relapse. All long-term surviving mice (defined as \u2265 100 days) from the efficacy experiment were injected with 1X10<sup>5</sup> GL261 cells in the contralateral hemisphere and followed for survival. <b>Results</b>: In both preclinical efficacy experiments, median survival in the epacadostat monotherapy group did not differ from controls (approximately 30 days). Four of 8 mice (50%) treated with anti-PD-1 were long-term survivors in both efficacy experiments. In the epacadostat plus anti-PD-1 combination group, 81% of the mice were long-term survivors (7 of 8 in experiment 1 and 6 of 8 in experiment 2). Of note, none of the long-term surviving mice developed evidence of tumor; thus the median survival among the anti-PD-1 and epacadostat plus anti-PD-1 combination groups were both > 100 days. In the re-challenge study, all of the mice who underwent GL261 re-inoculation survived > 100 more days with no evidence of tumor recurrence. <b>Conclusions</b>: IDO1 inhibition with epacadostat increased the eradication rate of anti-PD-1 therapy in an orthotopic syngeneic GBM model and long term survivors rejected tumor following orthotopic re-challenge. Further combinatorial studies incorporating IDO inhibitor therapy for GBM, including mechanistic studies, are warranted.","keywords":"Immunomodulation;NA;NA;NA","organ":"Brain/central nervous system cancers","topic":"Immune checkpoints","target":"IDO1","tumor":"Glioblastoma","combo":"SMI_checkpoint","sage":"immunosuppressive","pharma":"academia"}
