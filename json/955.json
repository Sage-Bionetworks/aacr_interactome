{"ID":"955","institution":"Eli Lilly","authors":"Kyla Driscoll","text":"The transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) signaling pathway is a pleiotropic cellular pathway that plays a critical role in cancer. In fact, aggressive tumors are typically associated with high ligand levels and thus associated with poor prognosis in various tumor types. Cancer cells use autocrine and paracrine TGF\u03b2 signaling to modulate tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment leading to a highly invasive and metastatic phenotype, inducing and increasing tumor vascularization, modulating the extracellular matrix in the stroma, and inhibiting immune surveillance and antitumor immunity. Clinical studies with galunisertib (aka LY2157299 monohydrate), a small molecule inhibitor targeting the TGF\u03b2 pathway, have provided proof of concept data supporting the role of TGF\u03b2 in cancer and the utility of targeting the TGF\u03b2 pathway.<br />Here we describe the identification of LY3200882, a next generation small molecule inhibitor of TGF-\u03b2 receptor type 1 (TGF\u03b2RI). The molecule is a potent, highly selective inhibitor of TGF\u03b2RI embodied in a structural platform with a synthetically scalable route. It is an ATP competitive inhibitor of the serine-threonine kinase domain of TGF\u03b2RI.<br />Mechanism of action studies reveal revealed that LY3200882 inhibits various pro-tumorigenic activities. LY3200882 potently inhibits TGF\u03b2 mediated SMAD phosphorylation in vitro in tumor and immune cells and in vivo in subcutaneous tumors in a dose dependent fashion. In preclinical tumor models, LY3200882 showed potent anti-tumor activity in the orthotopic 4T1-LP model of triple negative breast cancer and this activity correlated with enhanced tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in the tumor microenvironment. Durable tumor regressions in the orthotopic 4T1-LP model were observed and rechallenge of congenic tumors resulted in complete rejection in all mice. In in vitro immune suppression assays, LY3200882 has shown the ability to rescue TGF\u03b21 suppressed or T regulatory cell suppressed na\u00efve T cell activity and restore proliferation. Therefore, LY3200882 shows promising activity as an immune modulatory agent. In addition, LY3200882 has shown anti-metastatic activity in vitro in migration assays as well as in vivo in an experimental metastasis tumor model (intravenous EMT6-LM2 model of triple negative breast cancer). Finally, LY3200882 shows combinatorial anti-tumor benefits with checkpoint inhibition (anti-PD-L1) in the syngeneic CT26 model.<br />In conclusion, we have developed a novel potent and highly selective small molecule inhibitor of TGF\u03b2RI for the treatment of cancer.","keywords":"TGF-beta;Tumor microenvironment;Tumor microenvironment;Drug discovery","organ":"Not Applicable","topic":"Drug targets in the microenvironment","target":"TGFBR","tumor":"Colorectal","combo":"SMI_checkpoint","sage":"immunosuppressive","pharma":"pharma"}
