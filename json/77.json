{"ID":"77","institution":"Heidelberg Pharma GmbH","authors":"Michael Kulke","text":"Background:<br />ATACs (antibody-targeted Amanitin conjugates) comprise a new class of antibody-drug conjugates using amanitin as toxic payload. Amanitin binds to the eukaryotic RNA pol II and thereby inhibits the cellular transcription process at very low concentrations. In the current study,<i> in vitro</i> and<i> in vivo</i> data of new ATACs targeting BCMA (B Cell Maturation Antigen, also known as CD269) are presented. BCMA is selectively expressed on malignant plasma cells like in Multiple Myeloma (MM) and hence considered an ideal target for Amanitin based ADCs.<br />Material and methods:<br />MM cell lines: NCI-H929, MM.1S Luc (stable luciferase transfected) and CCRF-CEM (BCMA negative).<br />Antibody: anti-BCMA Thiomab (Max Delbr\u00fcck Centrum, Berlin; derivatization and production at Heidelberg Pharma).<br />Synthesis of HDP-101: Maleimide amanitin compounds were conjugated to substituted cysteine residues of the anti-BCMA Thiomab.<br />Cell proliferation assay: Quantitative determination of cytotoxicity was performed by CellTiter Glo 2.0 assay (Promega) or WST.1 assay (Roche).<br />Animal models: Subcutaneous and metastatic Mouse xenograft tumor models with MM cell lines NCI-H929 and MM.1S Luc were performed in single-dose and multiple-dosing experiments. Tolerability was assessed in mice and non-human primates (NHP).<br />Results:<br />HDP-101 showed in vitro cytotoxicity on BCMA<sup>+</sup> cell lines in picomolar range, whreas no cytotoxic activity on BCMA<sup>-</sup> cells was observed.<br />In mouse xenograft models, HDP-101 caused dose-dependent tumor regression and complete remission after a single i.v. dose of 2.0 mg/kg and 4.0 mg/kg in s.c. xenografts and after single i.v. doses from 0.1 mg/kg to 2.0 mg/kg in disseminating xenografts.<br />Safety profiling in Cynomolgus monkeys revealed a good tolerability and therapeutic index after sequentially applied doses of 0.3, 1.0, and multiple dose application of 4 x 3.0 mg/kg. Hematology and clinical chemistry parameters were unaffected except liver enzymes and LDH: A mild to moderate and transient increase was observed. The half-life of the ADC in serum was 7-9 days; the free toxin was detectable at levels close to the lower limit of quantification only (LLOQ = 1.2nM).<br />Conclusions:<br />Targeted cytotoxic drug delivery to BCMA positive MM cell lines was achieved by using HDP-101, an anti-BCMA-ATAC. The mode of action of the payload Amanitin led to an efficient anti-tumor potential<i> in vitro</i> and<i> in vivo</i> with good tolerability in NHP studies. Using ADCs in the therapy of multiple myeloma is a promising approach, especially by using a cytotoxic agent whose mode of action differs from other commonly used toxins, like ATACs. First-in-human trial is expected to start in 2018.","keywords":"Anticancer therapy;Antibody drug conjugate;Antibody drug conjugate;Amanitin","organ":"Lymphoma: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma","topic":"Antibody technologies","target":"BCMA","tumor":"Myeloma","combo":"ADC","sage":"target-tumor","pharma":"pharma"}
