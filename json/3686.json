SGN-LIV1A consists of the microtubule disrupting agent, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), conjugated to the anti-LIV-1 humanized monoclonal antibody hLIV22. LIV-1, as a downstream target of STAT3, promotes the epithelial to mesenchymal transition that is important in the malignant progression to metastasis. We have previously shown that as a single agent, SGN-LIV1A displays target specific internalization and cytotoxic activity against a breast cancer cell line in vitro and also demonstrates antitumor activity in in vivo preclinical xenograft models with significant delay of tumor growth. We report here additive and synergistic effects when combining SGN-LIV1A with current chemotherapeutic modalities used in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Specifically, we show synergy between SGN-LIV1A in combination with either doxorubicin or Abraxane in MCF-7 breast cancer tumor model. In addition, we show additive effects when carboplatin or protein kinase inhibitors are dosed in combination with SGN-LIV1A in this tumor model. These findings support further evaluation and development of SGN-LIV1A in combination with standard of care chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of breast cancer.","keywords":"Antibody;Drug synergy;Drug synergy;NA","category":"EXPERIMENTAL AND MOLECULAR THERAPEUTICS","sage":"small combo ADC","moa":"chemotherapy"}
