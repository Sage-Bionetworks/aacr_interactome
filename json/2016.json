{"ID":"2016","institution":"National Institutes of Health","authors":"Roy Xiao","text":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer with a five-year survival of ~50%. HNSCC are linked to human papillomavirus (HPV+) or tobacco carcinogenesis (HPV-). The Cancer Genome Atlas recently analyzed 279 HNSCC, revealing that 30% overexpress <i>FADD</i> (Fas-Associated Death Domain), with or without <i>BIRC2/3</i> genes encoding cellular Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins 1/2 (cIAP1/2), which are critical components of the Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) Receptor signaling pathways that determine cell death or survival. The frequency of such mutations provides a window for potential therapeutics, as IAP antagonists have been shown to switch cancer cell TNF\u03b1 signaling from being pro-survival to pro-apoptotic. We recently showed that birinapant, a second mitochondrial activator of caspases (SMAC) mimetic that promotes IAP degradation, sensitizes HNSCC to cell death by TNF\u03b1 and eradicates tumors in combination with radiation in HPV- HNSCC models overexpressing <i>FADD</i>+/-<i>BIRC2</i>. ASTX660 (developed by Astex Pharmaceuticals) is a novel dual cIAP1/XIAP antagonist currently in clinical trials for treating advanced solid tumors and lymphomas. The objective of the present study is to determine the therapeutic effects of ASTX660 in HPV+/- HNSCC preclinical models. ASTX660 at nanomolar concentrations was found to potently inhibit cell proliferation (measured using XTT assays) and induce apoptosis (Annexin/7-AAD flow cytometry), and displayed combinatorial activity with TNF\u03b1, TRAIL, or cisplatin in multiple human HPV+/- HNSCC cell lines. Western blotting showed near complete degradation of cIAP1 expression at nanomolar concentrations in human HNSCC cell lines. Flow cytometry revealed that ASTX660 in combination with either TNF\u03b1 or cisplatin reduced MHC-I expression and increased PD-L1 expression, suggesting that potential synergistic efficacy could be observed in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Our results demonstrate that ASTX660 is a potential therapeutic agent for both HPV+/- HNSCC. Experiments evaluating the anti-tumor effects of ASTX660 as a monotherapy and in combination with radiation, cisplatin, and anti-PD-1 therapies are ongoing, using both human HNSCC xenograft and syngeneic mouse oral cancer (MOC) models.
