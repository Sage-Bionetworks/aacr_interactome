{"ID":"966","institution":"Epicentrx","authors":"Saheli Jha","text":"<b>Introduction:</b> RRx-001 is a novel systemically non-toxic small molecule macrophage stimulating agent with promising activity in an ongoing clinical trial in small cell and non-small cell lung cancer and in neuroendocrine tumors. In preclinical studies, RRx-001 activated normally immune-suppressive M2-like Tumor Associated Macrophages (TAMs) to express a series of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 TNF-\u03b1), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and interleukins-10 and -12, a profile that resembles the M1 activated macrophage state. Due to its chemotactic activity for macrophages, TGF-\u03b21 was hypothesized to be involved in the antitumor mechanism of RRx-001. We therefore compared expression patterns of TGF-\u03b21 and TGF-\u03b2RI in patient-derived biopsy samples obtained at screening and post RRx-001. As TGF-\u03b21 is closely associated with the induction of fibrosis, we also examined key fibrosis markers.<br /><b>Methods: </b>Tumor biopsies before and after treatment with RRx-001 were obtained from consented patients with NSCLC, SCLC, and neuroendocrine tumors in the QUADRUPLE THREAT Phase II clinical trial (NCT02489903). Post treatment biopsies were obtained following 6 weeks of once-weekly RRx-001 treatment co-incidental with the first on-study CT scan. Tumor samples were evaluated immune-histochemically with putative markers for TGF\u03b2 pathway activation (TGF-\u03b21, TGF-\u03b2R1), fibrosis (alpha-smooth muscle actin [\u03b1-SMA], Matrix metallopeptidase-9 [MMP-9], and Collagen III deposition), and macrophage activation. Patients were subsequently followed for tumor progression.<br /><b>Results:</b> Positive immune-histochemical staining for TGF-\u03b21 and TGF-\u03b2R1 was seen in all responding patients, and in none of the non-responding patients to date. In responders we also found that MMP-9 and \u03b1-SMA activity was down regulated post RRx-001. The down-regulation of these fibrosis markers is suggestive of less invasive malignancy. The number of tumor associated macrophages and their activation was related to the activity of RRx-001.<br /><b>Conclusions:</b> Our pre and post dose patient derived data to date indicate a correlation between TGF-\u03b2 signaling activation and a response to RRx-001 that may also correlate with increased numbers of macrophages, and their activation status, in the vicinity of the tumor. These data suggest that activation of the TGF-\u03b21 pathway, as evident by expression of TGF-\u03b21 and TGF-\u03b2R1 by tumor cells, could be a predictive biomarker for RRx-001 treatment.","keywords":"Macrophages;Drug delivery;Drug delivery;Chemokines","organ":"Lung cancer: small cell","topic":"Drug targets in the microenvironment","target":"TGFBR","tumor":"Lung","combo":"SMI","sage":"immunosuppressive","pharma":"pharma"}
