PI3K-\u03b3 is predominantly expressed in leukocytes and not expressed in most epithelial tumors or sarcomas. Genetic studies highlight an important role for PI3K-\u03b3 in myeloid-derived cells that constitute a key component of the immune suppressive tumor microenvironment (Schmid et al. Canc Cell 2011). Targeting PI3K-\u03b3 could therefore alter the immune tumor microenvironment, enabling the immune system to attack tumor cells more effectively. We are developing IPI-549, an investigational small molecule inhibitor of PI3K-\u03b3, and provide data to support the therapeutic potential of breaking tumor immune tolerance through PI3K-\u03b3 inhibition.<br />IPI-549 is a potent and selective inhibitor of PI3K-\u03b3 with favorable pharmacological properties. In vitro functional assays demonstrated that IPI-549 blocked bone marrow derived M2 murine macrophage polarization, but did not affect M1 polarization. Oral administration of IPI-549 to tumor-bearing mice resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition in multiple syngeneic solid tumor models at PI3K-\u03b3 selective doses. Analysis of the tumor-associated immune cells demonstrated that IPI-549 treatment results in decreased immune suppressive myeloid cells and increased CD8+ T cells, suggesting enhanced anti-tumor immunity. To address the requirement for targeting myeloid cells by IPI-549, CD11b+ cells were depleted from a transplanted whole tumor Lewis Lung Carcinoma model and the effect of IPI-549 on limiting tumor growth was abrogated. In addition, a myeloid-infiltrated B16-GMCSF model, but not the isogenic B16 model without GMCSF, was responsive to IPI-549. Studies in immune-deficient mice or CD8 T-cell depleted tumor bearing mice demonstrated the T-cell dependence of IPI-549-mediated tumor growth inhibition. IPI-549 treatment also led to a significant reduction in lung metastases in the 4T1 and B16-GMCSF models. Importantly, in vivo studies with IPI-549 in combination with the immune checkpoint inhibitors anti-PD-1, anti-PDL-1 and anti-CTLA-4 showed increased tumor growth inhibition in multiple models compared to monotherapies alone. These data can inform combinations for future clinical trials.<br />Our studies support a role for PI3K-\u03b3 in immune suppressive myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment and provide evidence that targeted inhibition of PI3K-\u03b3 by IPI-549 can restore antitumor immune responses and inhibit tumor growth in preclinical models. A Phase 1 study evaluating IPI-549 as an orally administered therapeutic, as a single agent and in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody therapy, in patients with selected solid tumors is expected to begin in early 2016.","keywords":"Tumor immunity;Tumor associated macrophages;Tumor associated macrophages;PI3K","category":"IMMUNOLOGY","sage":"small combo CPI","moa":"leucocyte kinases"}
