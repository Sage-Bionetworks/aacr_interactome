{"ID":"65","institution":"Morphotek, Inc","authors":"Earl Albone","text":"The random conjugation of toxins, dyes, peptides, or other payloads to monoclonal antibodies often targets free thiol groups generated by partial reduction methods or lysine residues using succinimide- or isothiocyanate-based chemistry. There remains a need for conjugation technologies targeting specific amino acid residues as a way to produce a homogeneous antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) product with a defined drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR). Our <u>RE</u>sidue-<u>SPE</u>cific <u>C</u>onjugation <u>T</u>echnology (RESPECT) utilizes two methods by which payloads can be conjugated to specific residues in an antibody. Our cysteine-specific conjugation method exploits a unique intrachain disulfide bond in the light chain of rabbit antibodies between residues 80 and 171 of the variable and constant domains, respectively. Our humanization strategy allows retention of the cysteine at position 80 with a free thiol group that is both amenable for residue-specific conjugation and compatible with optimal antibody biophysical properties including antigen binding and structural stability. This platform has been optimized via antibody engineering strategy stems from <i>in silico</i> modeling, extensive mutagenesis, and crystallographic studies, which have allowed defining the contribution of neighboring residues to the retention of a reactive thiol group as well as the desired humanized antibody\u2019s properties. Our C-terminal lysine-specific linkage method employs the transglutaminase enzyme that catalyzes the formation of a stable isopeptide bond between the \u03b3-carboxyamide group (acyl donor) of a glutamine and the \u03b5-amino group (acyl acceptor) of a lysine. While we found no acyl acceptor sites in recombinant wild-type IgG, all antibodies investigated lacked the C-terminal Lys447 due to cleavage by carboxypeptidase B in the antibody production cell line. Blocking the cleavage of Lys447 by addition of a C-terminal amino acid resulted in transamidation of Lys447 by a variety of acyl donor substrates in the presence of any non-acidic, non-proline amino acid residue at position 448. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) prepared using our RESPECT technology targeting the tumor associated-mesothelin protein produced uniform drug-to-antibody ratios (DAR) and were shown to be highly potent and specific <i>in vitro</i> and effective <i>in vivo</i> in reduction of tumor growth in a highly aggressive mesothelin-expressing xenograft tumor model.","keywords":"Antibody Engineering;NA;NA;NA","organ":"Not Applicable","topic":"Antibody technologies","target":"NA","tumor":"NA","combo":"ADC","sage":"technology","pharma":"pharma"}
