Lycera is developing synthetic, small molecule ROR\u03b3 agonists for immunotherapy of cancer.<br />We have previously reported that ROR\u03b3\u03b3 agonists increase type 17 cytokine and chemokine production, enhance cell survival and have single agent anti-tumor activity in syngeneic tumor models. Interestingly, transcriptional profiling and cytometry studies revealed that treatment of murine and human Th17 or Tc17 cells with ROR\u03b3 agonists increases the expression of costimulatory receptors such as CD137 and decreased expression of coinhibitory receptors like PD-1.<br />Given the importance of PD-1 in anti-tumor immunity, we further characterized the effects of ROR\u03b3 agonist on this pathway. In vitro treatment with ROR\u03b3 agonists significantly decreases mean fluorescent intensity and percent PD-1+ cells after resting and repetitive restimulation of Type 17 T cells. ROR\u03b3 agonists do not modulate PD-1 expression in ROR\u03b3-/- T cells. In co-cultures of wild type and ROR\u03b3-/- T cells in the presence of the agonist, ROR\u03b3-/- T cells have reduced PD-1 expression suggesting that ROR\u03b3 agonists induce a transmissible effect on ROR\u03b3-/- T cells. However, ChIP-seq data indicates that ROR\u03b3t does not directly bind to the promoter or enhancer element of PD-1. Transcriptional and epigenetic profiling experiments have identified several pathways modulated by ROR\u03b3 agonists that may regulate PD-1 expression. Reduced PD-1 expression following ROR\u03b3 agonist treatment has a functional impact as treated cells also resist PD-L1-mediated inhibition of cytokine production and proliferation.<br />Importantly, the decreased PD-1 expression observed after in vitro treatment with ROR\u03b3 agonists is maintained following adoptive transfer of tumor specific T cells. These cells are highly effective at controlling tumor growth without further agonist treatment in vivo, suggesting that in vitro ROR\u03b3 agonist treatment results in durable epigenetic changes.<br />In summary, ROR\u03b3 agonists have been shown to decrease checkpoint receptor expression while enhancing cytokine production and promoting long term survival and self-renewal of T cells. These results provide rationales for combining an ROR\u03b3 agonist with checkpoint inhibitor such as anti-CTLA4 or anti-PD-1. By integrating effects on different effector pathways, ROR\u03b3 agonists represent a promising immunotherapy approach for the treatment of cancer.","keywords":"Immunotherapy;Small molecule drugs;Small molecule drugs;Antitumor activity","category":"IMMUNOLOGY","sage":"small","moa":"immune"}
