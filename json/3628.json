We have adopted a knobs-into-holes antibody format and produced <u>T</u>-cell <u>d</u>ependent <u>b</u>ispecific antibodies (TDB), as full length, humanized IgG1 antibodies with natural antibody architecture, which allow one arm to target various B cell antigens while the other arm recruits T cells by binding to the CD3\u03b5 subunit of the T-cell receptor. One B cell antigen targeted is CD79b, a component of the B cell receptor complex, which has been clinically validated by an anti-CD79b antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) as a safe and effective therapeutic target for B cell malignancies (<i>Leukemia </i>2015 Pfeifer et.al).<br />In the present work, we show that anti-CD79b/CD3 TDB is active against lymphoma cells with a wide range of CD79b antigen levels in vitro. In addition, anti-CD79b/CD3 TDB appears to be insensitive to the status of cellular signaling pathways in lymphoma cells as it is active against cell lines that are resistant to the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib or an anti-CD79b ADC with a cleavable tubulin inhibitor as the payload. In vivo, anti-CD79b/CD3 TDB administration inhibited tumor growth in B-cell lymphoma xenograft models and resulted in potent B-cell depletion in the blood and spleens in a humanized murine model.<br />To assess the safety of targeting CD79b with a T-cell recruiting bispecific antibody in non-human primates, a surrogate anti-cynoCD79b/CD3 TDB with comparable in vitro potency was produced with a target arm that recognizes cynomolgus monkey CD79b and the same anti-CD3 arm. In a single dose pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics/safety study, anti-cynoCD79b/CD3 TDB administration at 1mg/kg resulted in potent B cell depletion, as well as T cell activation and proliferation, which was assessed by flow cytometry on blood and lymphoid tissue and immunohistochemistry on lymphoid tissue. The pharmacokinetic properties of anti-cynoCD79b/CD3 TDB resembled that of IgG antibodies; though with a faster clearance likely due to CD79b antigen internalization and enhanced binding to CD3 when compared to previously described anti-CD20/CD3 TDB. Transient cytokine release was observed as elevated levels of IL-2, IL-6, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha were detected within 24 hours following administration. Anti-cynoCD79b/CD3 TDB was well-tolerated in the majority of dosed animals without toxicologically significant findings.<br />Collectively, these preclinical data suggest anti-CD79b/CD3 TDB can be a potential therapeutic agent in B cell malignancies.","keywords":"Bispecific antibody;T cell;T cell;NA","organ":"Not Applicable","topic":"Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies","target":"CD79b","tumor":"Lymphoma","combo":"ADC","sage":"target-tumor","pharma":"pharma"}
