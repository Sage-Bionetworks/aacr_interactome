The most effective synthetic modifications to PBD cores have involved the conjugation of two DNA-interactive moieties via their C8-position to create PBD dimers capable of cross-linking duplex DNA which improves cytotoxicity. Similarly, other groups have focussed on adding large substituents to the C8-position of the PBD core to improve DNA-interaction and cytotoxicity. All of these approaches tend to increase the molecular weight of the compounds, although this has not prevented their successful development to the clinic, either as stand-alone agents (e.g., SJG-136) or as a component of Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) (e.g., SGN-CD33A).<br />During a structure-activity relationship (SAR), we embarked on a \u201cmolecular pruning\u201d exercise to sequentially reduce the length and bulk of the C8-substituent of a PBD monomer expecting the cytotoxicity to reduce with a decrease in length/bulk and to establish the minimal pharmacophore. Surprisingly, we found that reducing the length of the C8-substituent maintained cytotoxicity and in some cases enhanced it.<br />A 50 molecule library of C8-substituted PBD monomers was synthesized featuring C8-substituents of various chemical composition and length, with some containing aniline substituents. Cytotoxicity evaluation in several tumour cell types was carried out (e.g., primary CLL, JJN-3 and MDA MB 231 cell lines. Low nanomolar to high picomolar IC50 values were observed for several library members including DC-1-194 (IC50 = 4.2nM in CLL, and 0.79nM in MDA MB 231), DC-1-255 (IC50 = 9.5nM in CLL, and 1.1nM in MDA MB 231), DC-1-253 (IC50 = 8.4nM in CLL, and 10nM in JJN-3) and DC-1-275 (IC50 = 7.6nM in CLL, and 9.6nM in JJN-3). Remarkably, many of these more-active compounds had very short C8-substituents.<br />The observations reported here add to current understanding of the SAR of PBD monomer structures. However, there may also be significance for the future development of PBD-based therapeutic agents where there may be advantages to working with lower molecular weight molecules.","keywords":"DNA adducts;Cytotoxicity;Cytotoxicity;Anticancer therapy","category":"CANCER CHEMISTRY","sage":"ADC","moa":"NA"}
