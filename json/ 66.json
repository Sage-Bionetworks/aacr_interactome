{"ID":" 66","institution":"NBE-Therapeutics AG","authors":"Roger Beerli","text":"Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) are highly potent and selective anti-tumor drugs, combining the specific targeting of monoclonal antibodies with the potency of small molecule toxic payloads. Conventional ADCs are generated by chemical conjugation and yield heterogeneous mixtures with variable pharmacokinetics, stability, safety and efficacy profiles. In order to address these issues, numerous site-specific conjugation technologies are currently being developed allowing the manufacturing of homogenous ADCs with pre-determined drug-to-antibody ratios. Here, we employed sortase-mediated antibody conjugation (SMAC)-technology, to generate homogenous ADCs based on a derivative of the highly potent anthracycline toxin PNU-159682 and a non-cleavable peptide linker, using the anti-HER-2 antibody trastuzumab (part of trastuzumab emtansine) and the anti-CD30 antibody cAC10 (part of brentuximab vedotin). Characterization of the resulting ADCs <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> showed that they were highly stable and exhibited potencies exceeding that of ADCs based on conventional tubulin-targeting payloads, such as trastuzumab emtansine and brentuximab vedotin. The data presented here suggest that such novel and highly potent ADC formats may help to increase the target range available to ADC approaches, by reducing the threshold levels of target expression required.","keywords":"Anthracycline;Anticancer therapy;Anticancer therapy;NA","organ":"Not Applicable","topic":"Antibody technologies","target":"NA","tumor":"Many","combo":"ADC","sage":"payload","pharma":"pharma"}
