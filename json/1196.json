The tertiary amine functional group is a common structural motif present in many bioactive compounds, including antimitotics of the auristatin and tubulysin classes. Traditionally, conjugation of tertiary amines required drug derivatization or modification to remove an N-alkyl group, thus creating a readily conjugatable secondary amine. However, identifying appropriate modifications that do not compromise the activity of the drug is frequently time consuming and often unsuccessful. To eliminate the need for such structural modifications, we sought a method for stable conjugation and facile release through the tertiary amine functional group by creating linkers with a quaternary amine point of attachment. To validate the linker strategy, quaternary amine-based cleavable linkers bearing auristatin E were synthesized and evaluated as ADCs. The conjugates were stable in rodent plasma, and were potent and immunologically specific both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo </i>in a Hodgkin lymphoma xenograft model. A second application of this technology has been demonstrated with tubulysins, another class of potent antimitotics containing a tertiary amine at the N-terminus. A cleavable quaternary amine linker containing a tubulysin analog was synthesized and ADCs were prepared and evaluated. The tubulysin conjugates were potent and immunologically specific across a panel of cancer cell lines, including multiple MDR-positive lines. Furthermore, the tubulysin conjugate displayed \u2018bystander activity\u2019 in an <i>in vitro</i> co-culture assay. The quaternary amine linkers represent an advance in linker technology and will enable the evaluation of drug classes previously inaccessible as ADCs.","keywords":"Antitumor agents;Drug design;Drug design;Targeted drug delivery","category":"EXPERIMENTAL AND MOLECULAR THERAPEUTICS","sage":"ADC","moa":"NA"}
