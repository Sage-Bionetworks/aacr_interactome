Most reports focus on homogeneous ADCs that have a DAR (cytotoxic molecules per antibody ratio) of 2. Here we describe the preparation, biochemical characterization, and biological evaluation of ADCs made through conjugation of maytansinoids (DM1, DM4) to aldehydes derived from chemically oxidized <i>N</i>-terminal serines (SeriMab) engineered onto the antibody heavy chain (2 DAR) or both light and heavy chain simultaneously (4 DAR). ADCs prepared with a non-cleavable linker or a cleavable disulfide linker were homogeneous 2 or 4 DAR by MS analysis, and were produced in high yield with a monomer content of >98%. Despite conjugation at the N-termini of both the light and heavy chain variable regions, FACS analysis showed the 4 DAR SeriMab conjugates maintained binding to the target antigen.<br />The ADCs showed antigen-specific potency <i>in vitro</i> on a panel of target-expressing cancer cell lines. In the disulfide cleavable linker series, the 2 DAR SeriMab conjugate was 2-5 fold less active than lysine-conjugated Ab-SPDB-DM4 (3.4 DAR), while the 4 DAR SeriMab conjugate was comparably active on an antibody basis. The SeriMab conjugates also displayed strong bystander killing. Surprisingly, in the non-cleavable linker series, the 2 DAR SeriMab conjugate was up to 17-fold more active (depending on cell line) than lysine-conjugated Ab-SMCC-DM1 (3.5 DAR), and the 4 DAR SeriMab conjugate was up to 100-fold more potent than the SMCC-DM1 conjugate on an antibody concentration basis. In a P-gp-positive multi-drug resistant cell line, the non-cleavable 4 DAR SeriMab-maytansinoid conjugate was highly active while the 2 DAR SeriMab ADCs and lysine-conjugated maytansinoid ADCs were >100-fold less potent.<br />The unique oxime bond formed with the non-cleavable SeriMab-maytansinoid conjugate was found to be stable in circulation in mice for >3 days as assayed by affinity capture LC-MS. Polar carboxylic acid containing metabolites were identified which may lead to high cellular retention of maytansinoid species in cancer cells, yielding higher <i>in vitro</i> potency than lysine-linked ADCs in some cell lines.<br />The <i>in vivo</i> anti-tumor activity of disulfide cleavable 2 and 4 DAR SeriMab-DM4 ADCs was evaluated in a clinically relevant cancer xenograft model. The 4 DAR conjugate was active at 60 \u03bcg/kg (maytansinoid payload dose) and was more active than the 2 DAR conjugate at this same payload dose.<br />Using the SeriMab conjugation platform we show that <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> activity of site-specific ADCs can be dependent on amount of cytotoxic agent attached per antibody.","keywords":"Antitumor activity;Human monoclonal antibodies;Human monoclonal antibodies;NA","category":"EXPERIMENTAL AND MOLECULAR THERAPEUTICS","sage":"ADC","moa":"NA"}
