{"ID":"3682","institution":"Dana Farber Cancer Institute","authors":"Dennis Adeegbe","text":"Effective therapies for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain challenging despite an increasingly comprehensive understanding of somatically altered oncogenic pathways. It is now clear that therapeutic agents with potential to impact the tumor immune microenvironment potentiate immune-orchestrated therapeutic benefit. This study evaluated the immunoregulatory properties of two classes of drugs that modulate the epigenome, histone deacetylase (HDAC) and bromodomain inhibitors with a focus on key cell subsets that are engaged in an immune response. By evaluating human peripheral blood and NSCLC tumors, we show that the selective HDAC6 inhibitor ricolinostat promotes phenotypic changes associated with enhanced T-cell priming and function of antigen presenting cells. The bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 attenuated CD4+Foxp3+ T regulatory cell suppressive function and synergized with ricolinostat to facilitate immune-mediated tumor growth arrest, leading to prolonged survival of mice with lung adenocarcinomas. Collectively, our findings highlight immunomodulatory effects of two epigenetic modifiers that together promote T-cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity and demonstrate their therapeutic potential for NSCLC treatment.","keywords":"Histone deacetylase inhibitor;Lung cancer non small cell;Lung cancer non small cell;Immunomodulation","organ":"Lung cancer: non-small cell","topic":"Immunomodulatory agents and interventions","target":"HDAC6","tumor":"Lung","combo":"SMI","sage":"immune_effector","pharma":"academia"}
