{"ID":" 71","institution":"ImmunoGen, Inc","authors":"Qifeng Qiu","text":"Folate receptor \u03b1 (FR\u03b1) is an antigen that is overexpressed on the cell surface of solid tumors including ovarian cancer. The differential expression on cancer cells makes FR\u03b1 an attractive target for antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), and an ADC targeting FR\u03b1, Mirvetuximab soravtansine, has demonstrated promising activity and safety profiles in the clinic. Here, we employed a new linker (NL) to enhance the bystander activity of ADCs, which is the ability of ADCs to generate cell-permeable catabolites that can diffuse into and kill proximal cancer cells with little or no target expression. With the goal of improving the potency of anti-FR\u03b1 ADC in solid tumors with heterogeneous FR\u03b1 expression, we constructed the M9346A-NL-DM. M9346A-NL-DM is a conjugate of the tubulin-disrupting maytansinoid (DM), linked via a novel linker to M9346A, a humanized antibody that binds FR\u03b1 with high affinity. After cellular uptake and catabolism of the ADC, the new linker undergoes lysosomal cleavage followed by self-immolation to generate free DM that can readily penetrate neighboring cancer cells. Correspondingly, M9346A-NL-DM showed enhanced bystander cytotoxic activity against proximal antigen-negative cells <i>in vitro</i>. In the xenograft tumor models <i>in vivo</i>, M9346A-NL-DM demonstrated enhanced efficacy against tumors with heterogeneous expression of FR\u03b1. Interestingly, M9346A-NL-DM also showed improved antitumor activity against a tumor model with homogeneous expression of FR\u03b1, possibly due to better tumor penetration of the cell-permeable catabolite. In summary, M9346A-NL-DM is a novel ADC with enhanced bystander activity and antitumor activity that can target tumors with heterogeneous expression of FR\u03b1.","keywords":"Antibody;Drug design;Drug design;NA","organ":"Gynecological cancers: ovarian","topic":"Antibody technologies","target":"FR\u03b1","tumor":"Many","combo":"ADC","sage":"linker","pharma":"pharma"}
