{"ID":"4591","institution":"Netherlands Cancer Institute","authors":"Julia Boshuizen","text":"Upon therapeutic pressure, cancers commonly select for drug-resistant, invasive subpopulations with elevated expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL. Besides the correlation between high AXL expression and induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, a process known to support metastasis, ample evidence also links AXL to resistance against a variety of targeted therapies, including inhibitors of the MAPK pathway in malignant melanoma and the EGFR pathway in lung cancer.<br />AXL-107-MMAE (HuMax-AXL-ADC) is a therapeutic antibody-drug conjugate specific for AXL, containing the microtubule disrupting agent monomethyl auristatin E as the cytotoxic payload. AXL-107-MMAE was previously shown to induce potent cytotoxicity <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo, </i>which was dependent expression of AXL on the cell surface.<br />We evaluated the capacity of AXL-107-MMAE to target AXL-positive MAPK pathway inhibitor resistant tumor cells, using malignant melanoma as a clinically relevant example. First, AXL-107-MMAE was shown to induce cytotoxicity in BRAF-mutant tumor cell lines that showed AXL expression upon acquired resistance to BRAF-inhibitors. In contrast, no cytotoxicity was observed in the BRAF-inhibitor-sensitive, AXL-negative parental cell lines. In heterogeneous tumor cell cultures, treatment with a BRAF-inhibitor selected for AXL-high, MAPK pathway inhibitor-insensitive melanoma cells, which was prevented by combined BRAF-inhibitor and AXL-107-MMAE treatment. Interestingly, we observed marked AXL upregulation in biopsies obtained from patients after they developed resistance to MAPK pathway inhibitors compared to paired pre-treatment biopsies.<br />The <i>in vivo</i> potential of AXL-107-MMAE in malignant melanoma was demonstrated using BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-mutated xenograft model derived from a patient who developed resistance to the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib in the clinic. This indicates that AXL expression levels in treatment-resistant malignant melanoma are sufficient to induce tumor regression with AXL-107-MMAE, at least in this model system.<br />These findings merit clinical validation of the targeting of both treatment-na\u00efve and drug-resistant cancers with AXL-107-MMAE, either alone or in combination with other targeted therapies.","keywords":"Melanoma/skin cancers;Intra-tumor heterogeneity;Intra-tumor heterogeneity;Antibody-drug conjugate","organ":"Melanoma/skin cancers","topic":"Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies","target":"AXL","tumor":"Melanoma","combo":"ADC","sage":"target-tumor","pharma":"academia"}
