{"ID":" 46","institution":"Bayer AG","authors":"Anette Sommer","text":"Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are promising agents that are developed for targeted delivery of cytotoxic payloads to tumor cells. ADCs share a common design of antibody, linker, and cytotoxic payload. Despite significant efforts, the number of available payload classes with a differentiated mode-of-action that can successfully be employed to generate antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) is still rather limited. So far, only ADCs with microtubule depolymerizing or DNA binding payloads have been approved. The identification of ADC payload classes with a novel mode-of-action will increase therapeutic options and potentially help to overcome resistance. Inhibitors of the kinesin spindle protein (KSP/Eg5/KIF11) have generated interest due to their high anti-tumor activity. However, the transfer of the potency of small molecule KSP inhibitors (KSPis) to highly efficient clinical regimens with a sufficient therapeutic window remains challenging. Through the conjugation of a novel pyrrole subclass of KSPis to antibodies targeting different cancer antigens, we generated a panel of ADCs and characterized them both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. ADCs targeting either EGFR or TWEAKR/Fn14 showed strong and specific internalization and displayed specific and potent anti-proliferative efficacy <i>in vitro.</i> In cytotoxicity assays, these ADCs exhibited sub-nanomolar potency in antigen-positive cancer cell lines (EGFR/TWEAKR-pos. NCI-H292; TWEAKR-pos. BxPC3, LoVo) and more than 100-fold selectivity versus non-targeted control-ADC containing the same linker and the same payload. Furthermore, selective anti-tumor efficacy of EGFR- and TWEAKR-KSPi-ADCs was demonstrated <i>in vivo</i> using both cancer cell line-derived models of NSCLC (NCI-H292), urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC) (KU-19-19), and renal cell carcinoma (A498), as well as in the TWEAKR-positive patient-derived xenograft UCC model BFX469. At doses of 5-10 mg/kg qw or bw potent anti-tumor efficacy with treated-to-control ratios (T/C) between 0.16 to 0.28 as well as complete regressions were observed. In summary, KSP inhibitors have been established as a promising new payload class allowing the generation of highly potent and selective ADCs for the treatment of solid tumors.","keywords":"EGFR;Antibody-drug conjugate;Antibody-drug conjugate;Kinesin spindle protein inhibitor","organ":"Not Applicable","topic":"Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy","target":"TWEAKR","tumor":"Many","combo":"ADC","sage":"payload","pharma":"pharma"}
