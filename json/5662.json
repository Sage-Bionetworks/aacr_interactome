{"ID":"5662","institution":"Moffitt Cancer Center","authors":"Mengyu Xie","text":"FDA approved mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK) targeting inhibitors such as trametinib have recently been reported to enhance anti-tumor immunity in multiple preclinical models. It is hypothesized that the combination of such MEK inhibitors with immune checkpoint blockade will have synergistic effects and cause further tumor regression. Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-1 overcome immunosuppressive signaling in the activated T cells, yielding higher levels of Interferon-gamma (IFN\u03b3) release. IFN\u03b3 plays a key role in a wide range of immune responses by direct activation of JAK-STAT1 pathway through the binding of IFN\u03b3 receptor. JAK-STAT1 regulates transcription of downstream effector genes that are involved in tumor immune surveillance. Many studies have shown that in cancer cells, transcription of T cell chemokines CXCL9,10,11, as well as PD-L1 and MHC-I are induced upon stimulation with IFN\u03b3. While there are some recent studies indicating MEK inhibitors enhance T cell activity and function, here we report for the first time that targeted inhibition of MEK increases tumor cells response to IFN\u03b3 and results in significant upregulation of target genes including T cell chemokines, MHC-I, as well as PD-L1.<br />We treated a panel of 20 human lung cancer cell lines with MEK inhibitor U0126 followed by IFN\u03b3 stimulation, and showed that the expression of CXCL10 is significantly increased as compared to IFN\u03b3 stimulation alone. Furthermore, we found that instead of MEK inhibition, knock down of KRAS in the KRAS mutant cell lines such as A549 and H2122 results in more dramatic CXCL10 upregulation upon IFN\u03b3 stimulation. This indicates the potential of increasing tumor T cell infiltration upon MEK targeted therapy. Next, to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism, we analyzed JAK-STAT1 pathway in mouse lung cancer cell lines LKR, 344, and colon cancer cell line CT26, in which trametinib mediated synergistic expression of CXCL9,10, 11 and MHC-I, PD-L1 were observed. The phosphorylation as well as total protein of JAK2, STAT1 are increased in cells that are pre-treated with trametinib, as compared to IFN\u03b3 stimulation alone. Treatment of JAK inhibitor Ruxolitinib as well as knockout of IFN\u03b3R1 in LKR cells completely abolishes CXCL10 expression. Importantly, trametinib enhanced response to PD-1 blockade in the lung tumor models. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that targeting MEK signaling in cancer cells increases the response of IFN\u03b3 through JAK-STAT1 pathway, which may potentially enhance immune surveillance and response to immune checkpoint blockade.","keywords":"MEK Inhibitor;Tumor immunity;Tumor immunity;Chemokines","organ":"Lung cancer: non-small cell","topic":"Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy","target":"MEK","tumor":"Many","combo":"SMI_checkpoint","sage":"cancer_cell","pharma":"academia"}
