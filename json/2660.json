Zoledronic acid (ZA) has been proven to inhibit angiogenesis, invasion, and adhesion of tumor cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of antibody treatment towards the T-cell checkpoint inhibitor PD-1 alone or in combination with ZA in BC mouse model.<b> </b><br /><b>Experimental Design:</b> The<b> </b>4T1-Luc mouse mammary tumor model was used in this study. The anti-tumor efficacy of anti-PD-1 antibody alone or in combination with ZA was monitored by measuring tumor volume and bioluminescence imaging (BLI). At the end of study, the tumor immunohistochemistry was performed to confirm the <i>in vivo</i> observation and flow cytometry was used to determine the immune cell population in tumors. The survival rate was also calculated to evaluate the treatment efficacy.<br /><b>Results: </b>The results showed that mice treated with the combination therapy exhibited the best antitumor response compared to untreated controls or single therapy. Furthermore, Combination therapy inhibited tumor regrowth as determined by BLI imaging, and thus significantly improved the median overall survival compared to other groups.<b> </b><br /><b>Conclusions: </b>Our study provides evidence for enhanced clinical BC treatment benefit from targeting co-signal molecules by combining PD-1 blockade with ZA treatment.","keywords":"Breast cancer;Zoledronic acid;Zoledronic acid;Checkpoint inhibitior","organ":"Breast cancer","topic":"Immune checkpoints","target":"zoledronic_acid","tumor":"Breast","combo":"SMI_checkpoint","sage":"cancer_cell","pharma":"academia"}
