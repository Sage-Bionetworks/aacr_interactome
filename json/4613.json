{"ID":"4613","institution":"Texas Tech University","authors":"Soni Khandelwal","text":"Breast cancer (BC) is the second leading cause of death among women with an estimated 246,660 new cases of invasive breast cancer expected to be diagnosed this year. Of the different subtypes, 15-20% are classified as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) because they lack three key receptors; progesterone, estrogen and HER2. These receptors are considered essential for \u201ctargeted therapies\u201d. Thus, systemic chemotherapy is the only TNBC drug treatment option. In this study, two clinical monoclonal antibodies; Herceptin\u00ae and Avastin\u00ae were covalently labeled with redox selenium and used to treat two TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468) in culture. TNBC cell lines were treated with vehicle control, increasing concentrations of selenium as Selenite (ranging from 2 to 20 \u00b5g); Se-Herceptin\u00ae or Se-Avastin\u00ae and compared to native antibodies with equal concentrations of protein. Cell counts and viability were analyzed using Beckman ViCell Counter and Trypan Blue exclusion over a seven day period. Selenite, Se-Avastin\u00ae and Se-Herceptin\u00ae were observed to be more cytotoxic over dose and time to both TNBC cell lines in comparison to control cells and cells treated with native antibodies alone. Morphological changes were observed under phase contrast microscopy in all selenium treated cell lines. In contrast, visible alterations in morphology were absent in native Herceptin\u00ae and Avastin\u00ae treated cells compared to control cells. We believe this is the first report of selenium Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) being demonstrated as cytotoxic to these TNBC cell lines, suggesting a potential strategy to design more effective treatments of TNBC resistant to chemotherapy.","keywords":"Breast cancer;Immunotherapy;Immunotherapy;NA","organ":"Breast cancer","topic":"Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies","target":"NA","tumor":"Breast","combo":"ADC","sage":"payload","pharma":"academia"}
