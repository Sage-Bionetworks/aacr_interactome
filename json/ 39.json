{"ID":" 39","institution":"Tarveda Therapeutics","authors":"Brian White","text":"Here we describe the discovery and the structure of PEN-221, a somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2) targeting peptide conjugated to DM1. PEN-221 is the first clinical compound from Tarveda\u2019s Pentarin platform, which utilizes miniaturized drug conjugates that diffuse rapidly and deeply into solid tumors. Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) have garnered a significant amount of attention in their ability to direct cytotoxic drugs to cancer cells; however, the efficacy of ADCs in solid tumors is limited by the slow diffusion of such large molecules through solid tumor tissue. Pentarins are designed to improve the efficacy of targeted therapies through effective tumor cell targeting and enhanced tumor penetration.<br />SSTR2, a GPCR overexpressed in multiple types of neuroendocrine tumors, including small cell lung cancers, internalizes rapidly upon agonist stimulation, making it an ideal vector for delivering cytotoxic payloads. Examination of a variety of SSTR2 targeting ligands, as well as several potential conjugation sites, led to the identification of the C-terminal side chain of [Tyr<sup>3</sup>]-octreotate amide as the best conjugation site for a lipophilic payload. The use of DM1 as a payload afforded superior receptor affinity and receptor internalization when compared to other similarly potent microtubule-targeting agents. In vitro studies show that PEN-221 has receptor-dependent cytotoxic effects, and preclinical studies demonstrate PEN-221 induces tumor regression in several SSTR2 expressing xenograft models.","keywords":"Targeted drug delivery;Somatostatin receptor;Somatostatin receptor;Maytansinoid","organ":"Not Applicable","topic":"Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy","target":" SSTR2","tumor":"NA","combo":"ADC","sage":"target-tumor","pharma":"pharma"}
