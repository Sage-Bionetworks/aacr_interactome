{"ID":"4964","institution":"Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","authors":"John Hunt","text":"The enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) catalyzes the degradation of tryptophan along the kynurenine pathway, and is frequently expressed in human malignancies. The activity of IDO1 induces an immunosuppressive microenvironment in tissues by inhibiting T-cell function through local depletion of tryptophan and through generation of kynurenine pathway metabolites. Inhibition of IDO1 is expected to diminish the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and improve cancer patient outcomes, particularly when used in combination with cancer immunotherapy agents such as nivolumab and ipilimumab. In this presentation, we will disclose the chemical structure, enzyme inhibitory mechanism, in vitro potency and in vivo pharmacodynamic (PD) activity of BMS\u2019 IDO1 inhibitor currently in Phase I clinical trials. The compound is a potent and selective IDO1 inhibitor with no activity against another tryptophan degrading enzyme, tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO). It exhibited potent cellular activity, suppressing kynurenine production in HEK293 cells overexpressing human IDO1 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.1 nM) and in HeLa cells stimulated with IFN\u03b3 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.7 nM). The compound also potently restored T-cell proliferation in a co-culture of T cells and human cancer cells and in a mixed lymphocyte reaction where T cells were co-cultured with allogeneic IDO1-expressing dendritic cells (EC<sub>50</sub> = 1.2 nM). In vivo, when given once a day orally, the compound exhibited significant PD activity in mouse tumors grown subcutaneously in syngeneic hosts and in human tumors grown as xenografts in nude mice.","keywords":"Immunotherapy;NA;NA;NA","organ":"Not Applicable","topic":"Tumor microenvironment in drug development","target":"IDO2","tumor":"NA","combo":"SMI","sage":"immunosuppressive","pharma":"pharma"}
