In activated lymphocytes LAMP1 is described as a marker of degranulation.<br />Unexpectedly, by immunizing mice with a colon patient-derived xenograft (PDX) followed by a screening of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for selection of antibodies that specifically stain tumor plasma membrane and de-orphaning by Immunoprecipitation-Mass spectrometry, we identified LAMP1 as the target of several antibodies. One of them, Ab-1, showed binding to the luminal domain of human LAMP1 with nM affinity. Crystal structure of its Fab with LAMP1 extracellular domain, showed that the epitope was non-linear, not a glycotope and spanned between position 29 to195.<br />LAMP1 expression was further documented by IHC with Ab-1, showing limited cell surface expression in normal tissues while moderate to high plasma membrane expression was found in a number of breast, including TNBC, colorectal, gastric, prostate, lung and ovary tumors.<br />The humanized Ab-1 mAb, humAb-1, was shown to display rapid cycling after binding to LAMP1 at the surface of colo205 cell line, allowing internalization and processing of a number of LAMP1/antibody complex 10 folds higher than the number of LAMP1 molecules at the cell surface.<br />humAb-1 was conjugated to DM4 maytansinoid derivative using an SPDB cleavable linker to generate a new antibody-drug conjugate, SAR428926, for the treatment of patients with cell surface LAMP1-positive tumors.<br />Conjugated and naked antibody displayed similar affinities for LAMP1. SAR428926 killed tumor cell lines (engineered to express cell surface LAMP1) in the sub-nM range. In contrast, no target-mediated cytotoxicity was observed when SAR428926 was incubated with normal cells, including resting or activated lymphocytes.<br />PDX models reflecting the pattern and level of LAMP1 expression at the surface of human tumors were selected to evaluate SAR428926 in<i> vivo</i> efficacy. Outstanding <i>in vivo</i> activity was observed in different indications, including TNBC, lung and colon PDXs, with complete regressions after a single administration at 5 mg/kg.<br />These encouraging preclinical data have prompted the initiation of IND-enabling studies with the goal to progress humAb-1-ADC to the clinic in patients with tumors expressing LAMP1 at the cell surface. The First-In-Human trial has been initiated in October 2015.","keywords":"Antitumor activity;Antibody drug conjugate;Antibody drug conjugate;NA","category":"EXPERIMENTAL AND MOLECULAR THERAPEUTICS","sage":"ADC","moa":"NA"}
