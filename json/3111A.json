{"ID":"3111A","institution":"ADC Therapeutics","authors":"Francesca Zammarchi","text":"Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is an attractive target for an ADC approach as it is over-expressed by virtually all prostate cancers and its expression is highest in poorly-differentiated, metastatic and castration-resistant cases. PSMA has limited expression in non-prostatic tissues, it is not secreted or cleaved by PSMA-expressing cells, and it is constitutively internalized, a process that may be accelerated by specific antibody binding. ADCT-401/MEDI3726 is an ADC composed of a monoclonal antibody (J591), directed against human PSMA, site-specifically conjugated (drug-to-antibody ratio of 1.8) to a highly cytotoxic DNA cross-linking PBD dimer with a valine-alanine dipeptide linker. <i>In vitro</i>, ADCT-401/MEDI3726 demonstrated potent and specific cytotoxicity in a panel of PSMA-expressing prostate cancer cell lines, whereas its activity was greatly reduced in PSMA-negative cell lines. <i>In vivo</i>, ADCT-401/MEDI3726 showed strong anti-tumor activity against CWR22Rv1 and LNCaP human-derived prostate cancer xenograft models. In the CWR22Rv1 model, a tumor with low, heterogeneous PSMA expression, ADCT-401/MEDI3726 achieved dose-dependent anti-tumor activity when administered as single dose at either 0.33 or 1 mg/kg, which resulted in significant increase in survival compared to the vehicle-treated animals. Moreover, a single dose of ADCT-401/MEDI3726 showed remarkable superior anti-tumor activity compared to multiple doses of another PSMA-targeted ADC stochastically conjugated to the auristatin payload vcMMAE with a DAR of ~4. In the LNCaP model, ADCT-401/MEDI3726 resulted in dose-dependent anti-tumor activity when dosed once at 0.11, 0.33 or 1 mg/kg. In the PSMA-negative prostate cancer-derived PC3 xenograft model, ADCT-401/MEDI3726 and an isotope-control ADC showed limited tumor growth inhibition highlighting target-mediated anti-tumor activity. ADCT-401/MEDI3726 demonstrated potent and specific <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> anti-tumor activity in prostate cancer-derived models of differing levels of PSMA and this warrants further development of this ADC into the clinic.","keywords":"Prostate cancer;antibody-drug conjugate;antibody-drug conjugate;pyrrolobenzodiazepine","organ":"Genitourinary cancers: prostate","topic":"Antibody technologies","target":"PSMA","tumor":"Prostate","combo":"ADC","sage":"payload","pharma":"pharma"}
