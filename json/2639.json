{"ID":"2639","institution":"Selvita S.A.","authors":"Micha\u0142 Ga\u0142\u0119zowski","text":"GCN2 is a protein kinase capable of sensing amino acid (AA) shortage. It gets activated by binding of unloaded tRNAs and subsequently phosphorylates translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2\u03b1) eventually leading to induction of ATF4-mediated integrated stress response (ISR). Elevated catabolism of one of the essential amino acids - tryptophan (Trp), driven by overexpression of critical enzymes in Trp metabolism - IDO and TDO, leads to immunosuppressive microenvironment in many types of cancer. GCN2 is a key effector signaling component for IDO/TDO and is considered as a metabolic checkpoint of highly Trp-dependent T-cells. GCN2 activation through accumulation of unloaded tRNAs leads to inhibition of CD8+ effector T-cells and increase in generation and activation of regulatory T-cells. According to these findings, selective inhibition of GCN2 may be an effective strategy for targeting Trp-dependent immunosurveillance of tumor cells. In this study, we report the results for a series of novel small molecule GCN2 kinase inhibitors that have been developed at Selvita and, to our best knowledge, are the most potent GCN2 inhibitors reported so far. Newly synthesized compounds exert low nanomolar potency for GCN2, good selectivity as well as ADME profiles. Profound assessment of the compounds potency and efficacy using a selection of <i>in vitro</i> activity/binding assays will be presented.","keywords":"Kinase inhibitors;Stress response;Stress response;Immunomodulation","organ":"Not Applicable","topic":"Immunomodulatory agents and interventions","target":"GCN2","tumor":"NA","combo":"SMI","sage":"immunosuppressive","pharma":"pharma"}
